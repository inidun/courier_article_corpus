^V Ajoint UN programme against
^ Aids&
rTo strengthen efforts to fight the spread of Aids,
j six United Nations Agencies have agreed to co¬
operate in a joint United Nations programme on
HIV-Aids. The agencies are the World Health
Organization (WHO), the UN Development
Programme (UNDP), the World Bank, the UN
Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN Children's
Fund (UNICEF) and UNESCO. The programme,
which will combine existing efforts and will be
administered by WHO, will come into opera¬
tion in January 1996.
. '' The specialized agencies concerned have
already been involved in combatting the Aids
pandemic for almost a decade. Here is a brief
account of their activities:
World Health Organization: its Global Pro¬
gramme on Aids helps individual countries to
take short-term measures in response to the
crisis and to establish long-term national pre¬
vention programmes. Today national Aids pro¬
grammes have been established in virtually every
country of the world, most of them with WHO
advice and guided by WHO's Global Aids
Strategy. WHO also provides financial resources
and equipment, carries out epidemiological
monitoring, supports the development of vac¬
cines and research into new approaches to Aids
prevention and care.

United Nations Development Programme:
UNDP's particular responsibility is to provide
support in tackling the social and economic reper¬
cussions of the epidemic and minimizing its
impact on human development. Its mandate is to
increase awareness, expand the capacity of com¬
munities to respond, assist prevention, care, sup¬
port and treatment programmes for women and
help to develop multi-sectoral HIV strategies.

World Bank: the largest source of finance for
Aids prevention programmes. Since 1986 cumu¬
lative lending for Aids prevention and control in
some 40 countries amounts to over $500 million.

United Nations Population Fund: in 1992,
UNFPA supported Aids prevention and control
activities in 84 countries. It provides information
and counselling on Aids prevention, and dis¬
tributes condoms as part of maternal and child
health and family planning programmes.

United Nations Children's Fund: UNICEF
distributes information through school cur¬
ricula and health education programmes,
notably to women and children at risk. It also
provides orientation and training for those likely
to come into contact with Aids patients and
their relatives, and works to expand primary
health care services, with particular attention
to the sterilization of medical equipment. It is
also examining ways of caring for the growing
number of Aids orphans.

United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization: Unesco supports an
interdisciplinary approach to Aids-related prob¬
lems, associating knowledge of their socio-cul¬
tural, ethnic and scientific aspects with a mastery
of communication techniques. UNESCO/WHO
pilot projects in school-based Aids education
adapted to different socio-cultural contexts have
been undertaken in different world regions. An
Aids School Education Resource Centre
(ASERC) for the gathering, exchange and dif¬
fusion of educative materials for young people
of school age has been set up at UNESCO Head¬
quarters. It contains over 2,500 publications
and 150 video films from all the world regions.
Bibliographies and extracts of didactic mate¬
rials are regularly published.

The World
Foundation
for Aids
Research and
Prevention was
established in January 1993 by the
Director-General of UNESCO, Mr.
Federico Mayor, and Professor Luc
Montagnier, who discovered the
human immunodeficiency virus. The
goal of the Foundation, whose
president is Prof. Montagnier, is to
mobilize all kinds of private
initiatives, to create new partnerships
and find new forms of co-operation,
especially in research and prevention,
in order to support and add to action
taken by public authorities in the
fight against Aids.
Stimulus for research
One of the Foundations priorities is to
build an international network of pilot
research centres in order to stimulate
co-operation between researchers. The
first three centres arc being established

A World Foundation for Aids Research and Prevention
in Paris, Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire)
and in California (U.S.A.). A
fourth is planned for Asia.
The purpose of the pilot pro¬
ject at the Saint-Joseph Hospital
in Paris is to create rapidly a
centre that combines clinical
examinations and laboratory
testing in order to ensure reg¬
ular follow-up of a cohort of
asymptomatic HIV-positive
patients receiving associated
treatment. The centre is due to
open at the end of 1995. Fol¬
lowing a media campaign called
Sidaction, carried out in France
in April 1994 under the auspices
of Luc Montagnier with the
major anti-Aids organizations,
the Foundation received 25 mil¬
lion French francs, which will
enable the centre to meet run¬
ning costs for two years.
The Abidjan Centre will be
concerned with applied research
and training and will also work
with Côte d'Ivoire 's National
Centre for Blood Transfusions
(CNTS) on the follow-up of
HIV-infected patients. The Ivo-
rian government has already ear¬
marked a site for the centre,
which will receive support from
WHO and the joint UN pro¬
gramme on HIV/Aids. The
centre will reach out to Africa as
a whole, opening branches in
interested countries with the help
of doctors and scientists from
industrialized countries who wish
to take part in this international
effort. The Foundation has
already sent a technician to the
CNTS and fitted out a labora¬
tory to launch a research project
in connection with the latter.
Negotiations have begun
with institutions in Los Angeles
and Pasadena (California,
U.S.A.) to set up a research
centre that will work with the
Paris and Abidjan centres.
A window of hope
The Foundation is encouraging
the creation of scientific com¬
mittees on Aids to complement
the work of these centres.
During a meeting of African sci¬
entists held in Paris under the
aegis of the Foundation and
UNESCO prior to the Paris
Summit on Aids of 1 December
1 994, it was decided to establish
an African scientific committee
and solidarity fund.
The Foundation will pro¬
mote the opening of new forms
of interdisciplinary co-operation
in order to identify any approach
that offers a ray of hope. A first
meeting with this in view was
held in Venice in October 1994
to establish a dialogue between
Aids experts and researchers in
other fields: physicists, mathe¬
maticians and chemists. Other
meetings will be held periodi
cally to promote similar forms of
co-operation.
Another of the Foundation's
priorities is to strengthen pre¬
vention by working with
UNESCO to find policies that are
most suited to each country's
socio-cultural context. Two pilot
projects are currently being car¬
ried out, one in Uganda and the
other in Ethiopia, in co-opera¬
tion with the universities of
Makerere in Kampala, Addis
Ababa in Ethiopia and Johns
Hopkins in the United States.
The projects are primarily aimed
at children and adolescents from
5 to 15, the age group least
affected by Aids and through
whom a "window of hope" may
open.
