~~ Ashioned from 39 
tonnes of travertino 
marble and five metres 
in length, this female form 
- entitled Reclining Figure 
- made of cavities and twists, 
eroded like a wind-beaten cliff, 
was deliberately created by 
Henry Moore as an enigma. 
After careful consideration, the 
sculptor did not want the statue, 
which is situated at UNESCO 
Headquarters, to express a 
precise theme or literal intention. 
“People should ask themselves 
what its meaning is,” he said. 
They should project their 
interpretation on it and use it 
as a sounding board for their 
thinking. In any case, a serene 
protectiveness emanates from the 
sculpture, whose stone comes 
from the quarries of Carrara 
in Italy, which were used by 
Michelangelo. 
Born in 1898 in Yorkshire, 
England, Moore was greatly

Sculpture 
influenced by primitive art and 
quickly built an international 
reputation. His first reclining 
figures, in powerful shapes 
inspired by nature, date from 
the 1920s. “From the start, the 
reclining figure was my main 
theme. I created the first around 
1924 and I think that after that 
more than half my sculptures 
were reclining figures. This 
obsession is particular to me.” 
As twisted, hollowed-out, 
abstract and monumental as they 
are, Moore’s reclining figures 
are also deeply human, at once 
intense and intimate. 
Moore was also a great 
draughtsman and produced a 
poignant series of remarkable 
drawings of people in the London 
Underground, sheltering from 
the bombs during the Blitz. 
“I had never seen so many sitting 
figures and even the tunnels 
reminded me of the holes in my 
sculptures,” Moore said.
