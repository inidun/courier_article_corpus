The magic of Lahore
by Chantal Lyard

I saw Lahore, star of the Punjab, at
night, and took its soul unawares. The
birds were roosting in the shadow of
the banyan trees. The pellucid notes
of a sitar were heard, and suddenly
a flute joined in.
According to the books, and to
hearsay, Lahore is the most beautiful
city in Pakistan. The Indus makes the
plain of the Punjab gleam with its
tributaries, which from earliest Antiq¬
uity have brought life and cultural
riches with them. Here at this fertile
crossroads Lahore was born and
grew, to become a key administra¬
tive, religious and business centre.
Lahore lies on a secondary track
of the Silk Road, and is watered by
the river Ravi. It assumed Its Impor¬
tance in the eleventh century, when
it became the capital of the sultans
of Rhazni. After a long period of tur¬
moil, destruction and short-lived
rulers it became ¡n the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries one of the
great cities of Mogul India.
Babur, founder of the Mogul
empire, made it a star of the first
order: under the Mogul dynasty
Lahore was adorned with buildings
that now form a splendid legacy.
I walked to the moonlit red sand¬
stone Fort. Founded, according to
legend, by Prince Loth, son of Rama,
it was rebuilt in the sixteenth century
by Babur's descendant Akbar and
embellished by his son Jahanglr and
his grandson Shah Jahan. The twenty
or so buildings contained within its
ramparts afford an excellent picture
of the development of Mogul art over
nearly two centuries. Audience
chambers and mosques, princely
apartments, royal baths and pavilions
are disposed around gardens, ter¬
races and ornamental ponds.
I dreamed awhile ¡n the Naulakha,
a small marble pavilion encrusted
with semi-precious stones in floral
and geometrical designs. I left the
Fort by the Elephant Passage (Hathi
Paer); and as I stood ¡n front of the
mosaics on the enclosure wall my
imagination for a moment conjured
up the festivities and pleasures of the
court, the elephant and camel con¬
tests, and the polo games. Nowadays,

in the dry moat, men in dazzlingly
white cotton scythe the grass, as
though to obliterate the passage of
time.
I saw the sun rise over Lahore, and
the rosy droplets in the dawn, when
the faithful come home from prayers.
I saw the sun light up the Shalimar
Gardensthe famous "Garden of
Love" laid out by Shah Jahan himself
in 1642. He had a canal dug to bring
water from the Ravi, to replenish the
ponds and irrigate the orchards and
beds of roses, cyclamen and iris.
The royal family would have come
out on to the three terraces, with
their slender marble and sandstone
pavilions set amid the delights of the
trees, and the music of the birds and
fountains, in search of coolness and
to be entertained with dances and
concerts. At nocturnal festivities the
light of camphor-scented candles
would have given the cypresses,
pomegranate trees and waterfalls
mysterious shapes.
The following lines, carved in the
stone beside a fountain, were once
wrung from the sorrowing heart of
Princess Zebun-Nisa, daughter of the
emperor Aurangzeb:
"0 waterfall, for love of whom
shed'st thou thy tears?
Whom mournest thou? In whose
memory hast thou furrowed thy
brow?"
I saw Lahore unfolding to the light,
its women clad in tulip- and mango-
coloured fabrics. The men sweltered
in the heat. In the Shahdara Gardens
I walked to Jahangir's tomb, erected
by his son Shah Jahan, who also built
the Taj Mahal at Agra, in India. An
avenue of venerable banyans and
huge fig-trees leads to the marble
and sandstone mausoleum. On the
enclosure wall a plethora of white
marble ornament representing bowls
of fruit, flowers and ewers is
arranged in elegant mosaics.
To reach the heart of the monu¬
ment I followed a passage decorated
entirely with frescoes from wall to
ceiling, and found myself in another
world. The wind sighed through the
cloisters of the cenotaph. All white
marble, it bears sacred inscriptions
in black marble the ninety-nine
attributes of the name of Allah.
Around the plinth run floral mouldings
in semi-precious stones lapis lazuli,
amethyst, agate and turquoise

mined in the Karakorum Mountains.
How gentle death seems, by the side
of this tomb!
I heard the five calls to prayer ring
out over Lahore. At the mosque of
Wazir Khan, in the heart of the old
city, I admired the brilliance of the
paradise flowers in the splendid cer¬
amic mosaics of this shrine built in
the reign of Shah Jahan. At the Bad-
shahi mosque with its daring marble
domes, built likewise in the seven¬
teenth century by Aurangzeb, the
sun flooded the huge square court¬
yard in which 60,000 worshippers
can pray at once. Its four minarets
climb high into the sky like soaring
birds.
I saw the burial-place of guru Arjan,
fifth prophet of the Sikhs, and the
Samadhi, tomb of the illustrious ruler
Ranjit Singhmagnificent relics, with
their fluted golden domes, of the
period (1764-1849) when Lahore
was the capital of the Sikh kingdom.
I saw Lahore in the middle of the
day, when men surrender to sleep
and a nightingale sings in the shade.
I saw the peacocks displaying in the
English parks, and breathed the
heady scent of the frangipani trees.
During the century of British rule
(1849-1947), a university, cathedral
and other public buildings were built
in the composite style known as
Mogul Gothic, and parks and broad
tree-lined avenues were laid out. The
first curator of the fine Lahore
Museum, which contains inter alia a
splendid collection of Mogul
paintings, was Rudyard Kipling's
father John Lockwood Kipling.
I left Lahore at the time of day
when people weave garlands of
roses, zinnias and marigolds for the
dead. Just before daybreak I betook
myself to the poet's tomb, cooled my
hands and forehead at a nearby foun¬
tain, and murmured to myself these
lines by Mohammad Iqbal:
"I would not let my heart become
attached to this garden:
I went my way, free of all ties."
