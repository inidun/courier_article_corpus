ples forming the basis of 
the new state 
This dual aspect – the 
spiritual home and the national 
reality – character izes the 
Pakistan of today. It explains too, 
certain paradoxes. For although 
Pakistan’s hope is to br ing 
together Moslems from all over 
pre-partition India, in reality 
40 million  Moslems  – or roughly 
30 per cent of the total number – 
are still scattered in other parts 
of the sub-continent. 
As a nation, Pakistan has defi-
ned frontiers and distinctive geo-
graphic and sociological features. 
As a spiritual home, it somewhat 
anticipates its national individua-
lity. For it must mould itself – 
with  undiminished creative zeal 
– in the image of the great pro-
mise it wishes to be, not only for 
its own people but also for all 
those who some day may come 
seeking a means of life in keeping 
with their faith.
The Golden Fibre
One has only to glance at a map 
to understand the complexity of 
the problems confronting this 
nation which has set itself such 
lofty requirements. Not only do a 
thousand miles of Indian Territory 
split East and West Pakistan but 
differences in climate, physiogra-
phy and even language separate 
the two regions. Eastern Pakistan, 
though by far the smaller area, 
has the larger population; yet it is 
West Pakistan, which is less 
 fertile, that compensates for the 
food shortages of the eastern 
zone. This zone (East Bengal) is 
almost entirely devoted to the 
cultivation of jute- the crop which 
enables the government to balance 
its national budget. 
Pakistan happens to hold prac-
tically a world monopoly of raw 
jute yet not only is the country 
unable to convert the fibre for 
lack of any jute-goods industry 
but inadequate port facilities even 
impede its exportation. 
To remedy this situation, the 
government has embarked on a 
series of vast industrialization 
projects for … 
Of all the countries which make 
up our inhabited globe, 
 Pakistan is perhaps the one which 
presents the most unusual cha-
racteristics. The laws defining its 
existence declared it was founded 
as a state where all Moslems could 
live according to the principles of 
Islam. As such it provides a spiri-
tual home for all members of a 
single religious community regar-
dless of their national origin. 
Nevertheless, Pakistan remains in 
the deepest sense of the word a 
nation. It groups under one uni-
f ied authority lands that for 
thousands of years have been 
inhabited by the same people, 
most of whom have shared for 
centuries the same moral, politi-
PakiStan – SPiritual home  
and national reality
There is more to Pakistan’s troubles than merely 
economic problems, asserts Lévi-Strauss in the first 
article he wrote for the Courier, in May 1951. A young 
nation founded on an ancient civilization, Pakistan 
synthesizes in its problems the whole of human 
development.

For even the most inten-
sive jute cultivation 
cannot be expected to 
absorb the manpower or 
assure the livelihood of 
p op u l a t i on  wh i c h

2,500 inhabitants per 
square mile. In fact for 
centuries the people 
have sought a secon-
dary means of income 
in cottage industries, 
such as the manufacture of muslin 
cloth which has made Dacca 
famous. But even these rural crafts 
are conditioned by unique circums-
tances. They depend on interna-
tional markets not only as a source 
for raw materials but as a sales 
outlet for the finished products. 
To take a specific case, in East 
Bengal, I recently visited a 
number of villages of incre-
dible poverty in the region 
of Langalbund not far from 
Dacca. There, over 50,000 
people live only by the 
manufacture of mother-of-
pearl buttons. These but-
tons of the kind used for 
cheap tee-shir t s and 
 under wear, are produced in 
huge quantities by hand 
tools which might well 
have belonged to the early 
Middle Ages. 
The raw materials needed for 
their production such as chemi-
cals, cardboard and the foil span-
gles used to mount the buttons 
on the cardboard, have ceased 
coming in from abroad since 
Pakistan became independent. …  continue on page 16

cription. Undoubtedly material aid 
must first be given to the adults; 
but surely the problem of re-adap-
ting and rehabilitating the children 
is no less important than that of 
other children during and after the 
last world war when psychologists, 
sociologists, psychiatrists and 
educators from all over the world 
joined to find a solution.
Pearl button crisis
Similar problems – and others 
even more specialised – also face 
East Bengal. To solve them will 
require no small degree of

tion of the first jute 
mills   in Narayanganj, 
a hydro-electric dam 
and a paper mill on 
the Karnafully River,

new port at the Ganges 
Delta, power stations 
at Malakand, and sugar 
refineries at Mardan. 
But the immense 
problems of financing 
these projects and of transfor-
ming a large portion of illiterate 
peasants into technically and 
socially educated workmen pre-
sent formidable obstacles. Here

improved by the introduction of 
small specially manufactured, hand 
operated machines. These would 
simplify the different stages of 
work in the button industry. But 
who better than UNESCO can draw 
the attention of scientists and 
technicians to the fact (which they 
so often tend to overlook) that 
the purposes of science are not 
only to solve scientific problems 
but to find answers to social pro-
blems as well. The efforts of 
science should not only enable 
mankind to surpass itself; they 
must also help those who lag 
behind to catch up.

… Following a world slump in 
demand, pearl button production 
in the villages has declined from 
60,000 gross per week to less than 
50,000 per month while the price 
paid to the village craftsman has 
fallen 75 per cent. 
This is only one example of the 
distressing problems facing 
Pakistan today. It would be a mis-
take, however, to view them 
merely as economic problems. No 
doubt the key to the dilemma lies 
first with the technicians.

one and the same time, it suffers 
and lives in our Middle Ages which 
its villages perpetuate; in our 
18th and 19th centuries which its 
first attempts at industrialization 
reproduce; in our 20th century 
whose advantages it is determi-
ned to secure. Perhaps the more 
developed nations, by providing 
Pakistan with some of the means 
to bridge these gaps and over-
come such contradictions, may 
learn in return how man can suc-

dual stature without denying any 
part of his heritage and of his 
past. 
