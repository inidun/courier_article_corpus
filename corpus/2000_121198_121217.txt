G a r l i c , knives and
b a n n e rs : f o o t b a l l ’s 
racist faces
The terraces of some of Europe’s biggest football clubs have become stomping grounds 
for racist abuse, though the problem stems far beyond match day
hree days into England’s new football
season and Patrick Vi e i r a , Fr a n c e ’s Wo r l d
Cup and Euro 2000 winning midfield
p l a y e r, is dismissed while playing for
Arsenal against Liverpool, earning his
second red card in as many matches.Th e
British press is quick to speculate that
he will quit the English game, invoking
the player’s own accusations that he has
been subject to “ r a c i s t ” intimidation from
players and officials alike. According to
Vieira, he is being singled out for abuse
not because he is black, but because he is
French—a complaint previously made
by expat footballers like Eric Cantona,
Frank Leboeuf and Emmanuel Petit.
Only months before, a defender playing
for West Ham faced disciplinary charges
after allegedly calling Vieira a “ Fr e n c h
p r a t ”and joking that “he could smell the
garlic”when the midfielder spat at him.
“What a load of nonsense,” commented
West Ham manager Harry Redknapp at
the time. “There is no way he should be
p u n i s h e d .What for? For having a joke?”
The true colours of fans
dancing with a swastika flag
In England, the cradle of football hoo-
l i g a n i s m , the debate over racism in foot-
ball has evolved.Overt racism among sup-
porters and abuse directed at black
p l a y e r s, both of which flourished in the
1970s and 1980s, have declined steeply in
recent years in the face of vociferous
public campaigning, though residual pre-
judices against foreign players have evi-
dently been unaffected. E l s e w h e r e, i n
c o n t r a s t ,much less trivial manifestations
of racism plague the game. Th r o u g h o u t
much of Europe, football grounds have
become hosts to deplorable displays of
supporters’ bigotry, providing outlets
through sporting rivalry to attitudes that
are either dormant or concealed in society
at large.
The recent conviction of Ricardo
Guerra for the murder of Aitor Zabaleta,a
Real Sociedad fan from Spain’s Basque
r e g i o n , is a case in point. Z a b a l e t a ’s death
came in the aftermath of the stoning of an
Atletico Madrid supporters’ bus after a cup
tie played in San Sebastian, during which
A t l e t i c o ’s notorious Bastion group of hoo-
l i g a n s,of which Guerra was a member,h a d
chanted “ F u e r a , fuera maricones, n e g r o s,
Va s c o s,C a t a l a n e s,f u e r a ,f u e r a ”(Get out,g e t
o u t ,q u e e r s,n i g g e r s,Basques and Catalans)
to the tune of the Spanish national anthem.
While the official line is that Zabaleta was
killed only because he followed a different
football team, the public perception of the
B a s t i o n ’s political sympathies was re-
enforced during the return game when they
were captured on film bouncing up and
down with a swastika fla g.
Several commentators have suggested
this racial hatred can be explained by the
i n fluence of neo-Nazi and neo-fascist
groups inside football grounds. A l o n g
with A t l e t i c o, extreme racism has
resurged among fans of Real Madrid and
Espanyol in Spain,Lazio and AC Milan in

English hooligans make themselves felt in Lille, France, during the 1998 World Cup.

Italy, Paris Saint-Germain in France and
Red Star Belgrade in Yu g o s l a v i a . In Italy,
U d i n e s e ’s attempts to sign the Je w i s h
player Ronnie Rosenthal were aban-
doned after anti-Semitic slogans were
daubed on the club’s office walls, while
Lazio fans unfurled a banner reading
“Auschwitz is your country, c r e m a t o r i a
your home” along with swastikas prior to
a game with local rival Roma.
The labelling of particular clubs or
fans as prototype fascists or racists,
h o w e v e r, is in fact deceptive.While Ger-
Cup Finals held in Italy in 1990, w h e n
Napoli fans abandoned the Italian
national team to support their local
Argentine hero Diego Maradona,“ u l t r a s ”
from northern Italy demonstrated their
hostility towards Maradona, Napoli and
the southern region by supporting any
team playing against A r g e n t i n a . As a
r e s u l t , the “ r a c i s t ”elements amongst nor-
thern fans had no problem cheering in
passionate support of the black A f r i c a n
team from Cameroon when they played
Argentina—the then embodiment of all
that the northerners detested.
Race as a weapon in the
arsenal of ritualized abuse
In short,the racism on display in Euro-
pean football matches is more often than
not dependent on the traditions and his-
toric rivalries within white fans’ cultures.
Here the concept of an “effective insult”
proves useful: fans will tend to use the
abuse that is most effective and pertinent,
in an effort to cause the most harm and
p r o v o c a t i o n . Supporters of English clubs
who have rivalries with clubs from Liver-
pool regularly sing “ I ’d rather be a Paki
than a scouse (Liverpudlian)” for the same
reasons Italian fans throughout the north
often refer to fans and players of southern
clubs such as Napoli as “ b l a c k s.” In each of
these cases, the effective insult is chosen on
the basis of racial outcasts despised by
both groups of fans, with the obvious aim
of making the insult as hurtful as possible.
To state a preference for the racial cate-
gory “ P a k i ” over the white identity of the
“ s c o u s e r ” might be seen to add venom to
the insult, while the association of sou-
thern Italians with “ b l a c k n e s s ” plays with
internal insecurities relating to the region’s
proximity to A f r i c a .
These insults only work because of the
stigma that these racial groups still suffer
in the minds of large swathes of white
European society. As such, race often
stands on the sidelines, ready to be mobi-
lized in circumstances where it is deemed
appropriate within the ritualized abuse of
a football game rather than forming the
political core of fans’ identities. The fact
that many of the Italian ultras’ chants are
adapted from traditional communist and
fascist songs is, in itself, no more evidence
of political sympathies than the extensive
use of hymn tunes among British fans is
evidence of ecclesiastical affil i a t i o n .
Comparisons between the insults
levelled in football grounds across the
world only goes to prove that racism
emerges against a backdrop of shared
prejudices among supporters. In Brazil,
for instance, where many fans are from
ethnic groups who are themselves mar-
ginalized and discriminated against, r a c i s t
abuse is rare (and is substituted by sexist
d e r i s i o n ) . In England, the success of black
players has shifted prejudice to the kind
of race-fuelled denigration mentioned
above or to the xenophobic “ h u m o u r ”
endured by Vi e i r a . In Eastern Europe,
and to some extent in Germany and Italy,
a comparative lack of black players has
left racist insults of these footballers as a
potent weapon in supporters’ armoury
of abuse.
The spectre of racism in the football
ground certainly is appalling,but its roots
lie neither in far-right factions nor in the
particular characteristics of fans. Vi o l e n t
footballing antagonism is the circumstance,
but European society is the cause. ■

many has one of the worst reputations
for far-right influence amongst its fans,
many claim that this image, fostered by the
German media,does not accurately refle c t
r e a l i t y. Professor Volker Rittner of the
Sports Sociology Institute in Cologne for
e x a m p l e,argues that “Nazi symbols have
a provocative role; they break down
t a b o o s.But the point is not political—it is
to get noticed and mentioned in Mon-
d a y ’s newspapers.” Even where there is
evidence of politically motivated racist
behaviour amongst fans, it is often uns-
t a b l e, contradictory and secondary to foot-
ball-related enmities. During the Wo r l d
