EDUCATION
THE BEST VACCINE
AGAINST ACCIDENTS
If the accident is a disease, education is its
vaccine and can be administered to every school-
age child. Each year thousands of English
youngsters visit the H.Q. of the Royal Society
for the Prevention of Accidents in the heart
of London for safety first lessons. With its
magnetic table on which typical road accident
situations are enacted (above), its many tests,
its bicycles running on endless belts (below)
the centre is a real Arabian Nights palace for
modern boys and girls and gives them valuable
training. Centres like this are still too few.

right kind of driving instruction at a scooter
school in Wembley, England. In Great Britain
beginner drivers are required to carry a letter
"L" prominently displayed on their vehicle.
