THE NEGRO
METROPOLIS
by Thales de AZEVEDO
of the University of Bahia, Brazil
THE best type of social
relationship between whites
and coloured people is pro-
bably to be found in
the regions colonized by the
Portuguese during the last four
centuries. This, for example, was
the impression which André Sieg-
fried formed after his travels round
the word.
Brazil, the biggest nation that the
Portuguese discovered and popu-
lated, is no exception to this rule.
In fact, one of the characteristics
of Brazilian cultural life is the
harmonious way the various
ethnic groups of native, European,
African and, more recently, Asiatic
origin, live together.
In pther lands too, it is true,
whites of different origin and
people of various colour groups,
live together peacefully and
without tension ; but in few parts
of the world today is the relation-
ship between whites and coloured
people (and especially the descend-
ants of African slaves) better
than in Brazil.
Active racial prejudices do not
really exist in Brazil, much less
any organized or open struggle
between whites and Negroes even
in those parts of the country, such
as the south-central and eastern
States, where Negroes are most
numerous.
Of all parts of Brazil, the State
of Bahia is undoubtedly the most
typical of Negro-white race rela-
tions. Its population consists for
the most part of white descendants
of the Portuguese, Negroes whose
ancestors were slaves brought
from Guinea and Angola, and
mulattos who are the result of the
constant lnesticagem (intermar-
riage) which has been going on
between whites and Negroes since
the middle of the 16th century.
(In fact, early colonial laws
banning the marriage of free men
and stave had become a dead
letter long before these laws were
done away with.)
If anything now tends to lessen
intermarriage, it is not so much
colour prejudice as the social
barriers fostered by class feeling.
Even this, however, is not very
strong, although it is unquestion-
ably stronger than colour prejudice
as such.
In Bahia, the capital of the State
of the same name, and one of the
most important cities of Brazil, a
little more than one-third of the
population of 400, 000 is white.
Twenty per cent is Negro, while
mestizos total about 47 per cent.
The number of whites is increas-
ing slowly-as slowly as theNegro population is decreasing ;
but mulattoes of all shades are
increasing at an ever mounting
rate which has now reached the
highest fIgure for all Brazil. This
is true even when compared to the
rate observed in those regions
where the greatest proportion of
Negroes live, such as the States of
Maranhào and Piaui in the far
north.
However, far more characteristic
than race mixture which is very
frequent in the lower levels of the
population but decreases in inten-
sity at the upper levels, are the
possibilities of advancement which
coloured people have in their local
communities. Since these commu-
nities are made up of multi-racial
classes in which caste is non-
existent, a man of colour can, as
the sociologist Donald Pierson has
shown"by reason of individual
merit or favourable circumstance,
improve his status and even
achieve position in the upper levels
of society and this position will
then be with reference not merely
to the darker group whose colour
he shares but to the total com-
munity." (1).
. A simple accident'
HAVT"IG more or less dark skinis regarded as"a simple
accident"of physical nature
which has nothing to do with
one's moral qualities or intellectual
ability. It does not predetermine
a person's social position but only
conditions it. For it is a symbol
or the low status which the major-
ity of the Negroes and mulattoes
have occupied throughout Brazilian
history as contrasted to the whites
who, despite the same political and
economic factors, were always
the dominant class of Brazilian
society.
Because of this, the lighter
skinned"wJÜter". mulattos find it
easiest to rise in the social scale.
In fact, when by reason of their
wealth, their talent, their political
influence or their university
degrees they reach a high position,
they are no longer considered
mulattos oj'mpsti : ; os, but whites.
It would be considered impertinent

and inelegant to remind such a
person of his ethnic background.
As in any other part of Brazil,
all racial groups mix freely in
theatres and cinemas, cafés and
restaurants, public conveyances,
churches, schools and in the
armed forces. This can be obseryed
more especially in Bahia where in
addition it causes less surprise
than elsewhere and where the
improvement in social position of
dark-skinned people is taken as a
natural thing.
Education is most important if
this improvement is to take place,
however. Bahians are fond of
saying that differences in their
social position are only a question
of education ; that anyone can rise
if he has reached a certain level
of instruction or professional
training and his moral conduct is
compatible with accepted local
patterns. Although the great ma-
jority of darker skinned coloured
people and mulattos are concen-
trated in the lower levels of society,
and in the lowest, humblest
occupations, many are to be found
in practically all the professions
which enjoy prestige.
Professions bring prestige
T IIl'S, coloured citizens work,not only with one another but
also among whites, as doctors,
judges, lawyer, engineers, uni-
yersity professors, priests, poli-
ticians, high government officials,
and-although relatiwly less
frequent-as businessmen, indus-
trialists, bankers and army officers.
Once they are classed as part of
these groups, they can enter scien-
tific societies, literary academies,
and the leading social and sporting
clubs.
It is to a great extent through the
liberal professions that poor
coloured people can achieve social
position. Among the poets, writers,
scientists and statisticians, whose
activities are a source of pride to
the people of Bahia and many
other Brazilians, there are many
coloured men-sometimes very
dark skinned and unmistakeably
Negro.
This is no romantic picture of
life in Bahia, painted with im-
pressions of hurried observation 01'
uncritical admiration but the result
of sociological inquiries based on
direct verification of the racial
composition of different"prestige"
groups and organizations in the
educational, sports, religious, poli-
tical, administrative and economic
fields. The writer of this article
himself undertook one of these
inquiries last year, under Unesco
auspices, as part of the programme
of social research in the State of
Bahia undertaken by the Founda-
tion for the Development of
Science in Bahia (Fundaçao ]JGra 0
Desenrolrimento da Ciencia na
l3ahia) in co-operation with Co-
lumbia University.
It must be pointed out, however,
that inter-racial relations in Bahia
are not entirely free from friction
and discrimination, but these are
often confused with antagonisms
of class. An analysis of the local
customs and social structure
shows that there are certain points
of resistance to the social rise of
individuals with the most pro-
nounced Negro traits. It reveals
that there are people in Bahia who
blame the Negroes for the eco-
nomic back hardness of the region,
as compared with other parts of
Brazil where industrialization and
economic advancement are much
more rapid.
In the upper class of society,
for example, inter-marriage runs
against barriers which at times are
extremely powerful, so that one
usually hears it said that except in
the case of marriage, no colour
prejudice really exists in Bahia.
In spite of this, however, a mulatto
who exercises a liberal profession
and who has a certain level of
income can marry an"aristo-
cratic"white girl-that is-one
of authentic European origin and
unquestionable white traits.
Paradoxical attitudes
MARRIAGE is the touchstoneof inter-racial relations. In
Bahia, the number of mixed
marriages is very high (about 20
per cent of all marriages), and the
social forces which formely ope-
rated to prevent them are now
diminishing.
There are coloured men with
responsible positions who marry
white women or at least girls with
skins much lighter than their own,
and for many of these men inter-
marriage opens the door to better
social standing.
A curious fact has been revealed
by a study of such cases. It shows
that a coloured man who marries
a white woman or a woman
of whiter skin than his own, is
much less likely to meet with
opposition from his wife's family
than is the dark-skinned woman
from the family of the white man
she marries.
These two attitudes which seem
paradoxical, are explained by the
fact that married couples in Bahia
live much more under the influence
of the wife's family than the hus-
band's, and the married man is
inevitably drawn more closely
into the family circle of his wife.
A coloured man is consequently
"raised in position"by joining the
family of a lighter-skinned or
white wife,'whereas a white man
who weds a dark-skinned woman
"steps down from his class". As
a popular Bahian proverb puts it,
"When a girl marries, her family
acquires a new son". By the same
token, a young man joins the
coloured community from'which
his wife happens to come.
But this occurs not only when
two different racial groups are
concerned, but also with different
social classes. Marriages between
educated and refined young men
(who happen to be poor) and rich
girls, are regarded more favour-
ably than those between men from
the upper classes and'women of a
lower class-regardless of colour.
The important thing is that the
man must be"educated and refin-
ed", so as to make up for his
poverty or his colour. In a sense,
therefore, he offers his"good cha-
racter"in exchange for his wife's
fortune and high social standing,
or her lighter skin colour-which-
ever the case may be.
These few examples show that
even though colour prejudices may
exist, they are not strong enough to
prevent inter-racial marriages in
the upper levels of society.
The fact is that antagonisms
between individuals and groups of
different racial stock is reduced to
a minimum in Bahia. Moreover,
they are further attenuated by the
process of adaptation and adjust-
ment which similarly affects other
aspects of social life, so that
competition tends to lose its
aggressiveness and conflicts much
of their bitterness. The people of
Bahia finally are very proud of
their traditions of tolerance and of
the absence among them of any
"racialism".
