THE VIBRANT
OF TRADITIONAL
B"LACK African music is not
meant just for the ear but for all
the senses and faculties of the body.
It reflects Africa's vision of the world
on earth and the world beyond, a
world of change and movement, a
world in permanent search of better¬
ment and perfection.
It is a music that demands total
attention, total absorption and recepti¬
vity to the supra-natural. It opens the
door to a strange world of the unreal
and the invisible, of spirits of every
kind, and marks a belief in the passage
of Man from this life to another,
beyond.
If to many Westerners African music
is little more than a jumble of incohe¬
rence, to the African its rhythms have
a coherence and depth which vary
according to the important events of
life such as birth, illness, recovery,
death.
African music has a cyclical quality,
for it symbolizes the actual life-cycle
of Man. And because it is cyclical, one
must never forget that it is made up of
"micro-cycles" or particles of sound
which are released into the air in the
extremely short musical phrases end¬
lessly hummed or strummed by the
musician, repeated over and over again
to the bewilderment and even the
despair of the European who finally
growls: it's boring and monotonous.
In reality, this apparent monotony is
part of a complex cycle made up of
elements which are vibrantly alive in
the flesh, blood, brain and heart of
the black man. The musical phrase
perceived by the ear is in fact only

FRANCIS BEBEY, musician, novelist and
poet of Cameroon, is responsible for the
music programme in Unesco. He has written
a book of Initiation into the traditional music
of Black Africa, the English edition of which,
'African Music", is soon to be published
by Hill and Wang, New York. Composer
and guitarist, he has given recitals of his
compositions In many countries and has
published three L.P. records of his works,
the latest being "Guitare d'une autre Rime"

1968, he was awarded the Grand Prix Litté¬
raire de l'Afrique Noire for his novel, "Le Fils

one part of an ensemble of perfectly
co-ordinated sounds which nourish the
entire body like the circulation of the
blood.
Continuing the comparison, we
might imagine that from a hole made
at a certain spot in the human body
the mouth in the case of song a
trickle of blood would emerge in a
continuous stream, flow in a circle
outside, and then return through the
same hole to join up again with the
circulation inside the body.
To the African the notion of cycles is
not restricted to the world of sound.
Sculpture and representational art pro¬
vide cyclic motifs whose meanings
have not always been properly un¬
derstood. The snake biting its own
tail, for example, has been interpreted
as portraying the clumsiness of the
most loathsome of reptiles. In fact,
the closed circle thus formed by the
snake represents either the will to
exclude anything extraneous from
a closely circumscribed world, or the
determination to live for ever the
circle being the symbol of continuity,
even within extemely restricted limits
in a world where everything con¬
stantly begins anew.
The "monotony" of black African
music thus takes on a compelling
significance for the educated person,
not only because it can be explained
in philosophical terms but also be¬
cause, even when considered tech¬
nically, it is seen to be the product of
detailed, conscious elaboration.
Some contemporary composers,
particularly in the field of light music,
are in fact increasingly drawing ins¬
piration from the so-called monotony
of Black African music in composing
works whose originality immediately
strikes the listener.
American jazz has already made ex¬
tensive use of this characteristic of
African music. Its famous riffs (1),
have not only contributed to the popu¬
larity of jazz but have also helped
to imprint the jazz repertoire on the
memories of countless listeners.
It should be noted that western clas-

sical music, which appears to be deci¬
dedly chary of such monotony, does
everything possible to get round it,
for example by resorting to subter¬
fuges like the fugue. Basically, the
art of the fugue consists in repeating
a usually short phrase at different
points in the scale, the various super¬
imposed repetitions conveying the illu¬
sion of renewal.
Yet when we listen to the music of
Johann Sebastian Bach, we are in the
presence of a phenomenon compar¬
able to that produced by certain forms
of Black African music, the only differ¬
ence being that with the latter we
do not have a single phrase which is
repeated at higher intervals, but an
infinite variety of rhythms on a given
phrase, which recurs again and again.
Frequently the purpose of African
music is action, with the dance not an
end in itself but a kind of transition, a
springboard to help the body fulfil the
mission assigned it. The action is
purely mechanical, since the aim may
be to draw out suffering from a sick
body by the force of music, accom¬
panied by rubbing and massage; or to
plough and sow the land to music,
or harvest the grain or bind up the
dead fittingly for burial.
The action may also be on a much
higher plane, when spirits are invoked
and entrusted with the soul of the
dead man; when a patient is cured
without being touched or given any
medicine except the magical power of
the dance; or when there is singing
and dancing to turn ill-fortune from a
village at the birth of twins.
Throughout the duration of this
music and its spell, thought plays
no part; it stands aside from the
performers' movements as if tempor¬
arily imprisoned. Facial expression
also reflects this inner state: the
mechanical, though not automatic ges¬
tures are performed unsmilingly. A few
minutes later, dancing may pass into
ecstasy.

AFRICAN MUSIC (Continued)
Here one sees the strength of the
music which, eliminating for a time all
power of thought, dictates directly to
the body the movements to be per¬
formed to heal the sick or bring rain
to the crops. Without this extraordi¬
nary power and driving force, many
of the rites of African life would be
impossible.
The instruments with which man tries
to "touch" music an intangible art
are highly prized: lutes, harps and
other stringed instruments plucked by
hand, demonstrate his desire to finger
sound. This explains why stringed
instruments are used for supernatural
ends such as divination, healing and
worship of the gods.
Among the Lemba in the Transvaal,
the Instrument representing the crea¬
tion of the world and the continuation
of the human race is the "sanza",
known also as "deza", a small portable
harpsichord with thin metal plates
plucked by the fingers. Each sound
plucked forth represents the birth of
a child somewhere in the world.
In the same way, among the Fali in
northern Cameroon, two drums beaten
with the bare hands at the moment
of death symbolize the everlastingness
of man, who is for ever born anew,
even if our eyes see his body pass
away. One of the drums symbolizes

the male principle, the other the fe¬
male. The concert of their sounds
gives life to a new being, destined to
replace the one who has just died.
But the real significance of this
symbol is the magical power of sound
drawn forth by the hand of man.
This symbol, incidentally, 'is found in
many African' communities, ranging
from those of the savanna, such as the
Fali, to forest-dwellers such as the
Fang of southern Cameroon or nor¬
thern Dahomey. The instrument used'
by the Fang to accompany epic tales
and legends is the "mvet", a kind of
portable harp or zither with strings
plucked by both hands. The Fang call
the performer "the zither-handler".
The instrument is used to create an
atmosphere of legend to accompany
the story-telling.
The story repertoire draws on ex¬
ploits from ancestral history, or the
lively inventions of mythology, which
continually receive new life from
music. From these sounds touched
by man's hands is born a driving force
which gives legends their strength and
a special status and prestige in the
life of the community. Sounds which
are well-known, yet ever new to the
listener, announce the departure of the

band of warriors led by Ovang-Obam-
O-Ndong for the kingdom of Engong,
where they hope to conquer immorta¬
lity for .all mankind.
Immediately the audience claps its
hands, is carried away and takes part
in the adventures of the long march
and endless wars, which always end
in failure: immortality will never be
accorded to man, despite the warriors'
desperate struggle to conquer it. But
the music keeps hope alive and hints
that, from one evening to the next,
other episodes will follow, giving the
narration its character of a legend of
unending hope, the very image of the
search for eternal life.
African music is not easy to un¬
derstand on account of its formal pat¬
terns, the nature of its sounds and
pitch and also its content. This is why
it will only yield up its secrets and
really influence the universal art of
sound, gradually... but profoundly. It
is music born of a meeting of indivi¬
duals whose collective aim is to inte¬
grate it with the life of their community,
so that against the general background
of life it plays a co-ordinating .and regu¬
lating role, using rhythm as its tool.
While the "griot", the wandering
minstrel, an age-old figure of the Afri-

can scene, declaims the praises of the
great at the top of his voice, recalls
the victories of the tribe and recounts
many other past exploits, rhythm beats
out the time for both present and
future. For while song fixes action in
the past, rhythm, through the alchemy
of movement, thrusts man towards the
future.
The journey to the next world, which
many believe to be so long-drawn
out, is thus given a stylized pattern by
Africans, with a simplicity some per¬
sons consider childish. Death does
not exist. Life and death are separated
by a wall which is invisible to the liv¬
ing, though the Telem, the predeces¬
sors of the Dogon on the cliffs of
Bandiagara, in Mali, choose to repre¬
sent it through the medium of a sta¬
tuette.
To cross the wall it is not in fact
necessary to see it. It is enough to
know that the wall is very thick, and
that to traverse it the dead man,
as soon as he expires, must take the
form of a needle or a snake with a
body slim enough to slip through, thus
passing from this life to the next.
Hence the thread-like statuettes dis¬
covered in this region of Mali, where
the worship of the dead and funeral
rites figure largely in the life of the
community. Music, choreography and
sculpture, with a variety of masks, play
an active part, all eager to maintain
and represent the idea of man's conti¬
nuity, one which we find also in other
African communities, often very remote
from Bandiagara.
Music is a vital spiritual need and
also a physical one, since it accom¬
panies all the labours and other acti¬
vities of life. Thus we begin to see
some possible purposes for music
which are not often envisaged, so
accustomed are we to thinking only
of its artistic aspects.
African music, comprising songs and
dances to celebrate different occa¬
sions in life, also contains an Impres¬
sive range of pieces devoted entirely
to work: songs or instrumental music
to encourage the worker. This reper¬
toire covers almost 50 per cent of
African ancestral music as a whole,
so it is worth considering more closely
what contribution this music can make
to Africa today, in the context of
development.
African music in the service of
development is an idea to bring a smile
to the lips of a true music-lover, for
whom the world of sound, ethereal and
intangible, is not concerned with the
problems of existence and everyday
life. Today, however, as in the past,
the rural economy of many African
regions Is still given much of its impe¬
tus by the stimulus of music. In the
forests of Africa women work on the
land in groups singing as they work.
Men sing as they fell trees, even in
modern logging camps.
In the savanna, work in the fields is
often carried out to the encouraging
accompaniment of the songs by one or
more "griots". In certain African
societies, the griot is the expert in the
lore of his ethnic group. He learns its
history, customs, laws, ways of think¬
ing, sometimes its magic, always its
music. He is the repository of the
culture of his people, and though his
knowledge is sometimes sketchy, he
is the reference source for an ancient
saying, the name of an ancestor, or
past exploits of the tribe.
Created by man, African ancestral
music lives, as does its creator, with
an eye to the future. It is "traditional"
only is the sense that there is no
better expression to distinguish it
from other kinds of music. Unlike a
tradition, which is petrified, and per¬
haps more appropriate to museums,
it marches on steadfastly towards the
future, destined to revolutionize that
future Jay a revival -of sincerity, by
means of laws which man has not yet
understood and a rhythm whose force
has not yet been sufficiently appre¬
ciated to be properly made use of.
Its subject is man. It recreates life
around legends old as time, as alive
as the huge trunk of the palaver tree
set in its dominating place on the
savanna and imperturbably fulfilling
its centuries-old rôle.
It is like a spring which gradually be¬
comes heady with rhythm and grows
and swells out of all proportions, to
become as mighty as the boiling Con¬
go. It demands to be known, studied
and respected for what it is, not for
what one would like it to be.
