Aerial view of Mirgissa, a fortress
in Sudanese Nubia whose citadel
kept watch over the Nile and the
rapids of the Second Cataract
nearly 4,000 years ago. When
these rapids became impassable
during the low water season, the
Nile boatmen outflanked them
by hauling boats along a slipway
constructed on the river bank.
1N 1963-64 the French Ar¬
chaeological Mission in Suda¬
nese Nubia began a systematic explo¬
ration of the archaeological conces¬
sion it had received from the Govern¬
ment of the Sudan. Special surveys
were made in the lowest-lying areas
most immediately threatened by the
waters of the Aswan High Dam.
In these operations, aerial photo¬
graphs of the area taken during 1958-
59 were invaluable. Standing out
clearly on one of these photographs
was a kind of track running from the
area of the west bank of the Nile
northwards to the village of Matouka.
I remember saying jokingly that this
was no doubt the line of a canal which
enabled the Egyptians to outflank the
dangerous rapids between Mirgissa-
Dabenarti and the Rock of Abusir.
At that time I had no idea how close
I was to the truth. The astute Egyp-

FOOTPRINT
IN THE SAND
Above, the recently-dis¬
covered slipway used for
dragging boats around the
Second Cataract of the Nile.
It was reinforced with
wooden poles, long ago
devoured by termites, but
whose emplacements can
still be seen. Right, a foot-
36 print, over 3,000 years old,
made in the soft mud by one
of the last sailors to drag
a boat along the slipway.

Above right, the only complete
sarcophagus recovered from the
cemetery at Mirgissa. A funerary
mask with breast plate attached
covers the face of the dead man.
The sides of the coffin are inscribed
with invocations. Above, the body
is exhumed from 9 ft. underground.

tians, however, did not build a canal;
instead they constructed a roadway
on land for their boats, thus anticipating
by many centuries the Greek
architects who conceived the idea of
roads along which ships were dragged
across the Isthmus of Corinth.
The Egyptian technique was remark¬
ably simple. They simply spread a
layer of Nile mud on the sands, after¬
wards reinforcing this half-made track
with wooden poles rather like railroad
sleepers. The imprint of these poles
is still clearly visible although termites
have long since devoured every
particle of the wood itself.
Illustrations on Middle Kingdom
tombs have shown us that the
Egyptians used these viscous subs¬
tances to move colossi far heavier
than the boats that plied the Nile. The
colossi were moved on sledges pulled
by teams of men. The overseer is
shown walking ahead pouring water
on the ground, and his action reveals
the nature of the ground: when silt
from the Nile is moistened it becomes
as slippery as Ice.
An architect friend of mine carried
out an experiment which proved this.
He laid down a track of silt in the
manner of the ancient Egyptians and
placed on it a huge block of stone
that had fallen from the temple of
Karnak. After he had wet the silt, his
problem was no longer how to drag the
stone along the ground, but how to
hold it back and keep it moving in
the right direction.
The technique of using wooden
posts, as revealed at Mirgissa, is
confirmed as a practice of the Middle
Kingdom period by a discovery at

Lahun. Here the Egyptians had used
them to reinforce a track leading from
a quarry, down which they slid huge
blocks of stone for the pyramid raised
by Seostris III.
Thus we have confirmation that the
two methods used by the Egyptians at
Mirgissa wet mud and posts re¬
inforcing the road were already
known in Egypt during the Middle
Kingdom.
I am quite convinced that we disco¬
vered at Mirgissa a slipway that
enabled the Egyptians to travel up
and down the Nile throughout the year.
The passage of the rapids on the
Second Cataract is difficult, though
possible, when the river is in flood.
But during the low-water season the
operation is quite impossible.
To maintain a link with Egypt by
river when the Nile was at Its lowest
level, the ancient garrisons in Nubia
had two alternatives: either to set
out on a long march across the desert
until they reached the next navigable
stretch of the Nile or to drag their
Kv
k
boats bodily overland around tho
dangerous rocks that barred their way.
The slipway discovered in 1964 is
remarkably well preserved. Hidden
by only a few centimetres of sand, it
still runs straight and level across
the land. Even the footprints of the
last sailors to pull their boats along
it are clearly visible on the dried mud,
as also are the marks made by the
timbers of the boats.
Already more than one kilometre
of the slipway has been uncovered
and our next task will be to locate the
exact points where this remarkable and
original highway begins and ends.
