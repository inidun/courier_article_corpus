THE most important new feature of Unesco's deftprogramme for 1950, approved by its Executive
Board last jronth, is a code of 18 directives which, if
adopted by the General Conference in September, will
become basic principles for Unesco. The directives will
serve as a "bridge" between Unesco's in generalized
form by its Constitution and the specific programme
resolutions. These directives, it is hoped will assist in
the orientation of Unesco's work and should, at the
same time, give the general public a clearer understand-
ing of the Organization's aims and activities.
