INQUIRY INTO A DISARMED WORLD (Continued)
of 1964-1965. The French poll was carried
out by the French Institute of Public Opinion
under the supervision of Madame Hélène
Riffault; the Norwegian survey, by the Inter¬
national Institute of Peace Research in Oslo,
under Johan Galtung; and the Polish inquiry
by the Polish Institute of Public Opinion,
under Professor A. Sicinski.
Persons polled were all 18 years or older,
of both sexes, and were asked to reply to a
series of some 30 questions on aspects of
disarmament and world affairs. The initial
inquiry sought to determine, first, how well
informed people are on international affairs
generally, and to what extent they are inte¬
rested in such problems. Another series of
questions sought their views on the prospects
of disarmament, and how they thought resour¬
ces thus released could best be used.
A detailed analysis of the replies should
help to throw light on the attitudes and values
that influence public opinion on such ques¬
tions as disarmament, and may be extremely
helpful in revealing factors most likely to
contribute to the attainment of world peace.
Already, however, one point is quite clear.
The polls carried out thus far in countries
with widely differing social and economic
systems, foreign policies and cultural and his¬
torical backgrounds, might have been expect¬
ed to reveal widely differing points of view.
The contrary has been found to be true with
a striking identity of views on most of- the
questions asked. Although this first stage of
the inquiry was limited to three countries, its
results suggest that it may well be a preview
of general opinion regarding attitudes towards
the world of tomorrow in which armaments
are drastically reduced or completely
discarded.
In your opinion what is
the greatest danger
man is facing today ?

Nuclear weapons, nu¬
clear warfare

clear' not mentioned)..
