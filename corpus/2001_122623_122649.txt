The world accord i n g
to Nicolás Buenaventura
Early on, Colombian storyteller Nicolás Buenaventura learned that “you have to invent the truth
every day.” With several storytellers in his family tree, he treats his gift with reverence and warmth of
spirit
fter a few minutes of introduction,N i c o l á s
Buenaventura realized that for the first
time, he was before an audience that had
grown up without listening to stories—
street children who had never heard of
The Little Red Riding Hood. It was
midnight in Bogotá and the faces of these
youngsters lit up. Once upon a time,
people referred to them as street urchins,
but as the country’s situation deteriorated,
they simply became billed as rejects.
So he decided to tell his version of
how the world was created.“There was
once a God who managed to resist the
unfortunate temptation of making Man in
his own image.First he created the Earth,
and when he saw it was round and
beautiful, he was left with lots of teeny
tiny bits and pieces.Then he created time
and when that started moving forward,h e
was left again with lots of teeny tiny bits
and pieces.” The children shouted and
clapped as the storyteller rose to a higher
emotional pitch to end his tale.“There’s
always a moment in life when you feel
you don’t belong in the world,and that’s
t e r r i b l e.But if you know the story of To m
Thumb, you know that even the tiniest
living thing has its place in the world.”
Buenaventura found his own place in
the world through storytelling.The boys in
his neighbourhood were quick to discover
his young talent. Because he did not have
enough money to go to the cinema, t h e y
clubbed together to buy him a ticket so
that he could tell them the film from A to
Z afterwards. Today he makes a living
from storytelling and dreams of directing
his second feature fil m .
Like all his family, Nicolás was born
with a storyteller’s gift.His father Enrique
is one of Colombia’s leading playwrights
and theatre
d i r e c t o r s. H i s
g r a n d f a t h e r
C o r n e l i o, a tireless
c o n v e r s a t i o n a l i s t
and professional
s t o r y t e l l e r, a l w a y s
repeated that “ y o u
have to invent the
truth every day.” So
whenever he walked
down the street,
people would call
out:“Hey, Cornelio,
make up a little bit of truth for me, will
you?”

But Nicolás did not get his enthusiasm
for storytelling from them.His inspiration
came from Fermín Ríos, a black
storyteller from Colombia’s main Pacific
port of Buenaventura.“Fermín told me:
‘I must tell you the story of the boy who
lost his bomboro [a magical realist term
that stands for any type of object],but he
never did. The next year, he said: ‘ N o,
you’re still not ready to hear it.’” Finally,
he died and Nicolás had to go searching
the world for the story himself. So far, h e
has found six versions of it—three in
Colombia and three in Africa.
The Colombian ones form the story of
the origin of the river Ti m b i q u i . On a visit
to Burkina Fa s o, he told the story in a
v i l l a g e. “Because I was a storyteller, I
w a s n ’t seen as a foreigner.People realized
I was bringing back stories they had given
or lent to us centuries ago.” Stories do
not need a passport to travel,he says.A l l
the world’s people ask the same
questions—why are we here, why do we
have to die, what are we made of?—and
the answers change from place to place.
For ethnologists, these oral stories stand
midway between question and answer.
After visiting three African countries,
Nicolás understood how “telling a story is
like putting bread on the table.”This only
enhanced his deep respect for all stories.
Perhaps it explains why he  staunchly
opposes his stories being used for other
p u r p o s e s, such as by schools to encourage
r e a d i n g.S t o r y t e l l i n g, he says, c a n ’t happen
without an audience. There is no set
ending in storytelling, and if there was
o n e, it would be a story in itself.
“Storytellers are the cups out of which
people drink stories,” he says.
Do stories change people? “In any
c a s e, they changed me. I’m more sensitive
now to life’s nuances.” And do stories
change the world? Nicolás replies by
telling what happened to him one night in
Bogotá as he was making his way home.
“I was suddenly surrounded by some
street kids and I thought ‘I’m going to
be robbed.’ But no. Instead,I heard one
of them shouting a familiar line at me:‘ h e
was left with lots of teeny tiny bits and
