Aging Chinese
face a w e l f a re g a p
The state welfare system is being dismantled, but a new pension scheme 
is not yet ready to take over
■
Liu Cunwa used to be a farmer in Sujiakou
Village in north China’s Shanxi Prov i n c e .
Now in his seventies, no longer able to work
and with no children to take care of him,Liu begs
or waits for hand-outs from villagers to get by.
Like millions of other elderly in the wo r l d ’s
fastest aging developing country, Liu has fa l l e n
through the gaps as the stat e - run cradle-to-
c r e m ation we l fare system is being dismantled and
a new old-age pension regime based on We s t e rn
models is slowly being bu i l t .
The gove rnment will have to work fast to fil l
the gaps. China is the wo r l d ’s fastest agi n g
d e veloping country. Within the next 30 ye a rs ,
there will be an estimated 275 million people—
more than the present total population of the
United States—in China over the age of 60.T h at
will mean roughly one in five people will be in
retirement or close to it.As a result of a one-child
family policy aimed at stopping the country ’s
e x p l o s i ve population gr ow t h , the financial bu r d e n
will become heavier for the shrinking proport i o n
of working people.
Pension reform:
a high priority
Tr a d i t i o n a l l y, the aged could rely on the
s u p p o rt of their children and gr a n d c h i l d r e n .A f t e r
C h i n a ’s 1949 communist revolution people like
Liu were guaranteed food, c l o t h i n g, medical care,
housing and bu rial expenses through the collective
fa rm .
Under the free-market reforms begun in the
l ate 1970s, Chinese rural families are once again
independent fa rm e rs. While the move to pri vat e
farming has made many parts of rural China rich,
it has also left the aged once again dependent on
either their families or themselves.
So far the gove rnment is only beginning to
introduce pension schemes in the country s i d e .
As a result of today’s one-child
family policy the task of
supporting tomorrow’s elderly
will fall on a shrinking
population of working people.

There has been much more progress on this front in
the cities, but even there progress has been slow.
Before the free-market economic reform s ,s t at e -
owned enterp rises provided for the elderly. N ow
the central gove rnment is cutting back on subsidies
to those enterp ri s e s , forcing them to look at the
bottom line. Recognizing that stat e - run enterp ri s e s
wo n ’t reach profitability without shedding their
social we l fare responsibilities, the gove rnment is
trying to find new ways of providing social safety
n e t s. T h u s , pension reform is being gi ven a high
priority. And none too soon either: elderly people
h ave recently mounted protests in a number of large
cities to press their companies to honour pension
commitments.
The aim is eventually to have a national pension
scheme with individuals, their employe rs and
insurance firms providing the bulk of retirement
f u n d s. The gove rnment is to be responsible only
for supplements.At the moment, t h o u g h ,m u n i c i p a l
governments are handling pension reforms in the
best way they see fit.
For example, in Foshan City in the southern
province of Guangdong, a pension fund has been
set up with employe rs contri buting an amount
e q u i valent to 10 per cent of wo r k e rs ’ wa g e s.Wo r k e rs
pay four per cent of their pay to the fund.
“The first step is always difficult to take,” said
Zhou Xiaochuan, President of the Constru c t i o n
Bank of China, calling for further pension reform at
the earliest possible dat e . “Otherwise China’s
pension system will face serious problems in the
decade between 2010 and 2020.” ■
