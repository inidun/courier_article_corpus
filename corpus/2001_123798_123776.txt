ou often say you’re
first and fore m o s t
a storyteller, a
“ g r i o t .” How does
this deep-ro o t e d
identity affect your
a p p roach to
theatre?
I draw my inspiration,my energy,
from meeting people. In my corner of
Africa—my parents were from
G u i n e a , I was born in Mali and I’m
Burkinabé by adoption—such
encounters are important, s i n c e
outsiders are the ones who bring us
what we don’t know.
I didn’t go to any drama school,
unless you count the great school of the
street—the school of life. When I was
y o u n g, a theatre producer friend,
Boubacar Dicko, asked me several
times to play parts for him.But it was
the last thing I dreamed of: at the time,
I was playing for Burkina Fa s o ’s
national football team!
Did you have a bad impression of
theatre?
When I was a kid, I enjoyed k o t e b a
p e r f o r m a n c e s, an old African tradition.
The word means “big snail.”They took
place in our neighbourhood and there
would be three circles—one of
children,another made up of women
and a third one of men. But in those
colonial days, the k o t e b a was dying out
and being replaced by Western-style
t h e a t r e. The French started drama
contests between all their West A f r i c a n
c o l o n i e s, which later became eight
c o u n t r i e s. Consciously or not, the idea
was to instil us with Western culture.

Despite years away from home and a career spanning many cultures, Malian actor

We weren’t allowed to speak our own
language at school. If we did, t h e
teacher would make us wear a piece of
wood or metal around the neck with a
m u l e ’s head on it and deprive us of
lunch. The best way to kill a tree is to
cut it from its roots.This We s t e r n - s t y l e
theatre also helped steer A f r i c a n
intellectuals away from the campaign
for independence.
What made you change heart?
I love dance and in 1966, I finally
agreed to be in a historical play
produced by my friend Boubacar
Dicko which featured a war dance. H e
also asked me to play a part as adviser
to the king. The play won a prize and
went on tour in the region. I became
attached to the show, and then to
a n o t h e r, based on a play written by
my uncle.
Gradually, acting grew on me. But
I wasn’t enamoured by everything—
not the courses run by Fr e n c h
instructors, for example. They told us,
without explaining why,how we should
walk on stage, which seemed far too
affected to me. They would ask us to
imagine a ship,to picture it on the wall,
but I couldn’t see anything. I left,
though by then, I ’d really become
taken with the profession.
I set up my own theatre company in
1966 with a group of 25 people.
Burkinabé radio gave us a place to
work and we mainly did
improvisations. I’d go to work at the
ministry for labour and public
administration in the morning, p l a y
football in the afternoon,and then go
off to theatre rehearsals. At the same
time, I was also writing my first play,
The Crocodile’s Lament. It was about
being sensitive, a gift with which you
can even manage to caress a crocodile,
as it actually happens in several regions
of Burkina Fa s o, where crocodiles are
viewed as sacred.
Sensitivity— is that what actors need
most? 
When I give courses, I do a lot of
work on being open, sensitive and
learning to communicate. Po l i t i c i a n s
always make speeches about
communication and dialogue. But it
all has to do with economic interests,
never human ones. You can’t
communicate if you don’t listen, and
people don’t listen to each other, e v e n
if they live in the same country.
E v e r y o n e ’s absorbed in themselves,
so exclusion grows. People risk their
lives to leave their country, and the
authorities close their eyes on all that.
Finding another way of communicating,
t h rough the efforts of actors fro m
different cultures working together, is
key to the approach of Peter Bro o k ,
who you met in 1983 for the gre a t
Indian epic The Mahabharata.
When I joined the Bouffes du
Nord Theatre in Paris, I had no
intention of staying in Fr a n c e.I ’d taken
a year’s sabbatical from my job at the
m i n i s t r y. The problem—or if you
prefer, the luck in my case—was that
The Mahabharata was a hit. I asked
the ministry to extend my leave, and
they gave me another year unpaid.
But when that was up, the play’s run
still hadn’t ended. I didn’t have an
understudy, and the play lasted nine
hours. I was brought up not to aban-
don something halfway through, I
c o u l d n ’t leave the company. But I’d
been with the civil service for 29 years
and was just a year away from being
able to draw my pension. I lost that,
and four months later, T h e
M a h a b h a r a t a closed and I was left
without a job back home. I didn’t want
to return to my family empty-handed

because as the oldest son,I was their
p i l l a r.It was very hard.Here in Fr a n c e,
I could struggle, work and continue
to explore my culture and being. Art
has never fed anyone in Africa.
You are said to have slipped into the
part of the wise man Bhisma.
When I joined Peter Brook, I didn’t
feel out of place. I could see everything
B rook has said your imagination was
nourished by a culture where the visible
and invisible worlds are not separa t e. I n
the parts you play, it often seems as if
you’re on an initiation voyage.
I come from a culture where
nature is very important in a person’s
life. Your soul is first incarnated in a
tree, then in an animal and then in a
living human being. Some people are
even named after trees.All this means
everything in the world is alive.
U n f o r t u n a t e l y, humans increasingly
think they’re the only living beings
on earth.
In Fr e n c h , you can point to
someone and say “ t h e r e ’s a person.” I n
several African languages, when you
say “person,” the word is followed by
something that means roughly “ t h e
person of the person.” That is, e a c h
human being comprises many
i d e n t i t i e s, which are in fact other
p e o p l e. Daily life is about discovering
all these beings within. This can only
happen  through  meeting other
people.
“When you meet another, instead of
losing yourself in his eyes, recognize
yourself—and perhaps you’ll see
y o u r s e l f,” the saying goes. Our wise
men tell us that ignorance is the worst
thing that can happen to anyone, w o r s e
than illness or death. And the most
ignorant person of all, they say, i s
someone who has never stepped
was happening inside a circle, just like
in A f r i c a , and on the third day, he took
my hand, looked me in the eye and
said:“Sotigui,from today, you’re part
of the family.” That was a magical
moment for me. He didn’t say:“ Yo u ’r e
part of our group, of our company.”
H e ’d understood the soul of an
A f r i c a n , h e ’d embraced my culture.
Brook is a universal man. For him,
there are no barriers between people,
which is rare in today’s world. Some
people don’t understand my loyalty
to Brook. But how can I not be loyal to
someone who defends such values in
today’s world, where separation and
individualism hold sway?
At his International Centre for
Theatre Research were 22 actors from
18 different countries. In T h e
M a h a b h a r a t a , the five Pandava
brothers were played by a German, a
Fr e n c h m a n , an Iranian, an Italian and
a Senegalese. This bothered no one,
and the play travelled the world for
four years. Only Brook could have
pulled  off such a feat.There aren’t any
races or skin colours in his mind.I’ve
also played Prospero in The Tempest
under him. It was the first time a
European director, a British
Shakespearean to boot, had staged
this play with a black Prospero.

e n c o u n t e rs. You once pro d u c e d
Antigone with Malian actors.
I t ’s through differences that you
find ways to work together. At the
request of the Jean Moulin Museum
in Paris, I produced a show in 1999 to
mark the centenary of the Fr e n c h
wartime resistance leader’s birth. I
adapted his diary, Le Premier Combat,
and merged it into a novel by the
Cameroonian writer Ferdinand Oyono,
Le Vieux Nègre et la Médaille. Th i s
shocked some of Moulin’s old
c o m r a d e s, but the director of the
museum, a historian, firmly defended
the project.
In recent months, I ’ve been working
on O e d i p u s, which follows naturally
from A n t i g o n e. I ’ve based myself on
several versions of the story, f r o m
Sophocles to Jean A n o u i l h , and even a
thriller on the theme. I ’ve read the
analyses of psychoanalysts from Fr e u d
to Tobie Nathan. All focus on incest.
For me, however, Oedipus is about the
problem of facing up to oneself. I ’ m
not trying to provide an answer, I ’ m
just raising the issue to foster awareness
of the battle that’s inherent in every
destiny, namely not to let ourselves be
overcome by fatalism.Is Oedipus guilty
of killing his father? At first he was
hailed as a hero who rescued a suffering
c o u n t r y. Then he was rejected by his
own sons and stoned to death before
the wall of Thebes by the very people
h e ’d saved. H e ’s a man on the run,
consumed by suffering, by an obsession.
If he’d come to terms with his human
weaknesses, he wouldn’t have gouged
his eyes out. I end my O e d i p u s b y
looking at what I think is the most
serious issue—the refusal to forgive.
The choir exhorts the gods to praise
the hero after his vain ordeal.
It’s an appeal to reason…
Forgiveness doesn’t heal everything
but it can make some things better. Is
there any sin so serious that it can
never be forgiven? Is evil 100 percent
e v i l , or can we find a little crack within
that can draw it closer to good?
You stand for deep-rooted A f r i c a n
v a l u e s, just like the character you played
in Rachid Bouchare b ’s film Little Senegal
(2000). Do you think these values are
under threat?
I’m always afraid of that,but I try
to fight with words and culture. Fo r
example in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina
Faso’s second city, my children and I
opened a cultural centre a few years
a g o. I set it up in the courtyard
belonging to my father, a very large
s p a c e.Today it’s a place where you can
learn music, percussion and painting, a
meeting place where we invite foreign
painters to teach courses.We also wish
to make it into a computer training
centre. Besides which,we are seeking
to create a university of A f r i c a n
traditions where we could develop
ways to preserve this heritage and
deepen knowledge of our culture.
You also set up the Mandeka T h e a t re in
M a l i , which encourages literary and
artistic creation.
We founded the Mandeka in 1997,
at the same time as France was
deporting charter plane loads of Malian
and Senegalese immigrants every day.
While that was happening, actors in
Bamako were still asking me how they
could come to France, as if they were
blind to how immigrants were being
t r e a t e d . When I advised them not to

g o, t h e y ’d stare at me as if to say:“ L o o k
at you,you’re doing alright over there,
and so are your sons.” The easiest way
out in the end was to say I couldn’t help
anyone in coming to France. But I was
ready to do what I could by fin d i n g
them jobs, courses or training. This is
what I had in mind when I founded the
Mandeka—stopping young people
from fleeing, helping them to win
respect through having a job and
showing people what they could do.
Antigone was performed in France by
actors from Mandeka.Les Bouffes du
Nord agreed to produce O e d i p u s, i n
which Mandeka’s Malian actors will
perform with French ones.
African theatre and films still have a
very low world profile, unlike African
music.
There is no African cultural policy.
Our filmmakers don’t have the money
to produce and distribute their work.
A few years ago, a lot more films were
given loans against eventual box-offic e
receipts from France because their
s u b j e c t s, often ethnographic, a t t r a c t e d
d o n o r s. But as African directors
became interested in other issues and
left folklore to one side, they secured
less and less money.As for the actors,
for years you could look through the
budgets of African films and not find
any mention of them.
In Mali and Burkina Faso, the film
authorities do what they can, but that
doesn’t go much further than lending
you vehicles and cameras.And it’s even
worse for theatre. The troupes you see
a b r o a d , in Europe,have to live off their
own resources.You can’t even say they
were once better off. When I founded
my own dance troupe in Burkina Faso in
1 9 7 1 , I received no funding. I went into
debt to buy musical instruments and
c o s t u m e s. Several times the government
seized them so they could represent the
country in foreign festivals or greet a
visit by the French president—without
ever giving us anything in return.
Do you feel you’re carrying a message
from Africa?
L e t ’s be modest.Africa is vast, a n d
it would be pretentious to speak in its
n a m e. I’m fighting the battle with
words because I’m a storyteller,a griot.
Rightly or wrongly, they call us masters
of the spoken word. Our duty is to
encourage the West to appreciate
Africa more. It’s also true that many
Africans don’t really know their own
c o n t i n e n t . And if you forget your
culture, you lose sight of yourself. It is
said that “the day you no longer know
where you’re going, just remember
where you came from.” Our strength
lies in our culture. Everything I do as a
s t o r y t e l l e r, a griot, stems from this
rooting and openness. ■
