AN INDIAN VIEW
The Place oj W OTnen
in Unesco
The article printed below is reproduced from the"Behar Herald,'"
Patna, India.
THE Charter oaf Unesco states that the purpose of the Urganization.will be realized by giving fresh impulse t  popular duc tion ana
the spread of culture by instituting collaboration amongst the natzons
to advance the idea Of equality of educational opportunity without
regard to race, sex or any distinction, economic or social.

It is of vital importance that
the intention to provide equality
of opportunicy for girls and
women, expressed with equal
forcefulness in the Education
Plan for India, should be imple-
mented. and not remain a vague
and unreallzed assertion.

No one w : 11 dent that the
greatest tnfluence on he child,
and hence on the succesding gen-
eration. derives trom the mother,
nor that MOmaK's true vocation,
settled biologically trom th dawn
of time, is motherhood. Yet it is
only comparatively recently that
recognition has been given to the
fact that the uneducated mother
can do the greatest harm to our
children through her own ignor-
ance, and hence can do the
greatest harm to the race. Even
woman's great function as a spiri-
tual gUide is vitzated by ignorance
and it tollows that that deep re-
ligious belief which inspires and
stirs the noblest sentiments can-
not be imparted effectually.
Discrimination
We in India are very conscious
of discrzm, nation in education bet-
ween the sexes. Our women today
are steeped in ignorance and
poverty. But it must at the
same time be admitted that
the general attitude to MomeK's
education can only be described
as lukewarm. It is the relatively
small handful at educated women
zn India who must act as pioneers
in their own tand. Further, they
must join width Unesco and loo

cation of children all over the
world.
It is the mothers in all land
who suffer from the doctrine that
might IS right on which the world
has rested so lar. and, in their
millions then not only see their
children slaughtered and maimed
but sense their children's failure

Women without education can
play but a small part in mould-
ing the tuture generation, and I
would be tempted today tc say
that in my country the education
ot girls should take precedence in
all schemes of educational develop-
ment over the educatzon of boys
until such time as the lag in girls'
education has been : overcome.
Women must be in Unesco and
the instruments organized to
achieve its aims to ensure'that
the essential opportunities to
learn are provided and, further-
more, provided in the right way.
Duty for omen
In the spread. ot scientific
knowledge there is an essential
duty for women. Here everything
possible must be done to ensure
that scientific advances shall be
directed to the b√®nefit and not
to the destruction Of mankind.
In the two wars In the lifetime
of this generation science has, to
its everlasting shame. been har-
nessed to the destruction of life
and its very : o7ts.

The motherhood of the world

Representation, however able
it may be, will be of little value,
unless women can unite in tlzeir
determznation that there shall be

ples, races and creeds. They have

Women are in particular the
