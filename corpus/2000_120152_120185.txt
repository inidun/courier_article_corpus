missing phone rings—in the pocket of the
policeman who was helping to look for it.”
Mobiles are popular because of the
d e a rth of fixed telephone lines in A f ri c a .I n
1998, Europe had 37 lines for every 100
people while A f rica only had two. T h e
D e m o c r atic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
has one for every 2,500 people while Mali
and Niger have fewer than two per 1,000. I n
A s i a , the average is 7.34 lines for eve ry 100
people, more than double the number in
L atin A m e rican countries like Cuba (3.21)
and Nicaragua (3.13).
Mobile phones have started to fill this
c o m m u n i c ations gap.Although 80 per cent
of them are currently found in ri c h
c o u n t ri e s , in the 1990s the number of
subscribers in poor countries grew faster
than anywhere else. A f rica had almost
3 . 5 million mobile phone subscri b e rs in
1998.More than 70 per cent of them were
in South A f ri c a , where gr owth in this sector
exceeded all expectat i o n s , according to the
I n t e rn ational Te l e c o m m u n i c ation Union
(ITU).In the same year, 17 per cent of all
phone subscribers in Africa had mobiles.
The figure for Asia was 30 per cent. I n
developing countries like the Philippines,
B o l i v i a , Azerbaijan and Estonia, m o b i l e s
h ave caught on much quicker than
expected.
“The less infrastructure a country has,
the more attractive it is to invest in mobile
phones,” says Nagib Callaos, who teaches
at Simon Bolivar Unive rsity in Caracas.
“ T h e r e ’s no need to create a demand; i t
exists already. In Venezuela, for example,
there’s no traditional phone infrastructure
and mobile phones have spread much more
quickly than in the United States.”
Fo rty million people in the world are on
waiting lists for a fixed-line telephone,
according to the ITU. In Venezuela,where
the wait is nearly five ye a rs , a lucrat i ve black
market has set in, with people paying the
equivalent of 10 times the minimum wage
to get a line. N ow it is possible to sign a con-
tract for a mobile phone and start using it
the following day.
This delights some Ve n e z u e l a n s ,“ w h o
use the time when they’re stuck in Caracas’
endless traffic jams to catch up on the
phone calls they’ve been meaning to
m a k e ,” s ays Callaos. H aving a mobile
phone is also useful from the point of view
of safety. “My daughter never goes out at
night without her mobile. I can call her
e ve ry hour or less to see if she’s OK,”
h e s ay s.
Exponential growth
in war-torn countries
A mobile phone network can be up and
running much more quickly than a fixed
o n e . In Romania, the firm Mobifon
launched its service in 1996,just four and
a half months after being granted a licence
to operate. Since there is no need to dig
trenches for cables, i n s t a l l ation costs less and
the investment is recuperated more rapidly.
In Venezuela, profits began to roll in only
three years after startup.
Mobile phones are also ideal for coun-
tries whose infrastructure is inadequate or
has been seriously damaged by wa r. E x a m-
ples include Lebanon and especially Cam-
b o d i a , where there are more mobile cel-
lular subscri b e rs than fixed telephones.T h e

Groups of small farmers in remote
areas of Côte d’Ivoire share mobile
telephones so they can follow hourly
fluctuations in coffee and cocoa prices.
This means they can choose the moment
to sell their crops when world prices are
most advantageous to them. A few years
ago, they could only have found out about
market trends by applying to an office in
the capital, Abidjan. Their deal-making
was based on information from buyers,
and this was not always reliable.
These coffee and cocoa gr owe rs are just
a few of the economic playe rs in poor coun-
tries who are today making shrewd use of
the mobile phones,one of the star features
of the information society.
“Communication is a universal need,
but communications technology can be
used in a va riety of way s ,” s ays UN E S C O
c o m m u n i c ations specialist Babacar Fa l l .
“Although a mobile phone may nominally
belong to a single person, in some African
c o u n t ries it is regarded as the property of the
community, because there is a culture of
sharing the tools of communication.”
A dearth
of fixed lines
Fall cites the case of Senegalese living in
Dakar or abroad who have bought their
relatives a mobile phone to stay in touch.
S o m e t i m e s ,s e veral families living in places
where the dream of getting a fixed phone

York or Rome.
Huge billboard ads in A f rica have made
mobile phones as popular there as Coca-

The ITU says the percentage of mobile
ve rsus fixed lines is proof of the vigour of the
mobile phone industry in countries of the
S o u t h . In Cambodia, mobile phones
appeared in 1992. Within a year mobile
subscribers exceeded the number of fixed
telephones and today, they constitute 72
per cent of all subscribers.The authorities
have even questioned the need to expand
the fixed network.
Fierce competition
between operators
Mobile phones will soon ove rtake fixe d
lines in Lebanon (now 45 per cent mobiles)
and Paraguay (43 per cent). In the latter,
mobile phone firm s , mostly pri vate and
backed by foreign investment, have bene-
fited from the ineffic i e n cy of the stat e -
owned fixed-line operat o r. (Unlike most of
its neighbours , Pa r a g u ay did not pri vatise its
t e l e c o m m u n i c ation operator in the 1990s. )
M a ny users choose to take advantage of
the ri va l ry between the four pri vate mobile
phone firms rather than remaining depen-
dent on the bureaucratic state company.
“The state has done poorly where fixe d
lines are concern e d ,” s ays the ITU’s Michael
M i n g e s. “Its role should be to open up the
market and create an open environment for
foreign inve s t m e n t .” B u t , he say s , the stat e
still has an important role as a regulat o r ,“ t o
fa c i l i t ate competition, to see that prices are
fair and to establish interconnections
b e t ween different systems, i n c l u d i n g
b e t ween mobile and fixed lines.”
In the beginning, it was thought that
mobile phones in poor countries wo u l d
only be used by the wealthy, and govern-
ments granted only one national mobile
phone operating licence. But almost half the
c o u n t ries with mobile phones now have
issued at least two licences, and the fierce
competition between operat o rs has helped
to reduce rat e s. This does not howe ve r
explain the current gr owth of a mass
m a r k e t , which is largely due to prepaid call
schemes.
The boom
in prepaid cards
The standard way of paying for a mobile
phone service is on the basis of a minimum
use of, say, two hours a month for a year.
Potential customers have to provide proof
of a regular income, sign a contract and
h ave a bank account and a perm a n e n t
address. But because the vast majority of
rural people in developing countries do not
have any of these, operators are using the
prepayment system.
This involves buying cards which pro-
vide phone time from five minutes to an
h o u r. C u s t o m e rs can use the credit as they
like over a period of we e k s , and so keep
control over their spending and enjoy a
ve ry cheap phone serv i c e . Prepaid cards
are widely available in local stores.
The potential market is huge.In 1998,
three ye a rs after the first prepaid mobile
phone scheme was launched, 40 million
people had opted for it—about 13 per cent
of the wo r l d ’s mobile users. In South A f ri c a ,
half of all subscribers chose prepayment,
and more than half in Mexico. In Senegal in
1 9 9 9 , one operator for the first time offered
a prepaid system as the only option.
After two months, the firm had wo n


In 1998, t h ree years after

4,000 customers. This system has tripled
and perhaps quadrupled the potential Lat i n
A m e rican market for mobile phones,
according to a study by the Strat e gis Group,
an international telecommunications con-
sultancy firm.
The prepaid system, which has been
called the “perfect marri a g e ”b e t ween tech-
nology and marketing, has led to an enor-
mous increase in the number of mobile
p h o n e s , but their contri bution to general
d e velopment is still ve ry limited. I n
L u bu m b a s h i , in southeastern DRC, f o r

guards have proven an effective we a p o n

n ow more efficient because of them. A n d
d u ring the recent elections in Senegal,
FM radio report e rs used mobiles to
i m p r ove their coverage (see box p. 6 8 ) .


But the cost of these calls is still too
high for poor people to benefit from this
technology. The mobile phone faces a big
challenge if it is to help the poor break out
of their isolation and to contribute to “the
social and economic development of peo-
p l e s ” t h at the first A f rican Deve l o p m e n t
Forum called for in Addis Ababa last year.
State initiatives
These are not empty wo r d s. T h e
Grameen Bank project in Bangladesh has
shown that it is possible to give very poor
rural people access to mobile phones (see
next article).Nevertheless,“many govern-
ments still regard mobile phones as a luxury
and won’t accept that they offer the best
opportunity of bringing modern commu-
n i c ations to the least developed areas,”
s ay s Michael Stocks, e x - c h a i rman of the
Global System for Mobile Communica-
tions (GSM) Association.
The role of the state is vital, not just to
ensure competition between mobile phone
operators but also to encourage ambitious
p r o j e c t s.The ITU suggests that , just as they
subsidise water and electri c i t y, g ove rn m e n t s
could help the poorest people to have access
to mobile phones or distri bute free prepaid
mobile phone cards on a massive scale.
Such steps would give a big boost to a rev-
olution that has so far been the privy of
those with money in pocket. ■
