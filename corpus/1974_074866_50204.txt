from constant handling, a length of
rope, knotted at regular intervals, lies
neatly" colled beside the mouth of the
Well. Untouched since the day nine
months ago when it hauled up the last
bucket of water drawn by hand by an
inhabitant of Chinguetti, the rope
mutely links sombre past with
hopeful present.
For this is no ordinary well, and
Chinguetti is no ordinary town. The
seventh most holy place of Islam, the
oasis of Chinguetti is a gruelling,
700 kilometre drive, along barely dis¬
cernible desert tracks, due east from
Nouakchott, capital of Mauritania.
Here deep in the Sahel, the semi-
arid region fringing the southern limits
of the Sahara and stretching across
the heart of Africa from Mauritania to
the Sudan, a crucial social and tech¬
nological experiment is being put to
the relentless test of practical applica¬
tion.
At the well, after centuries of ser¬
vice, knotted ropes and knotted
muscles have given way to a classic,
hydropump powered by sunlight ab¬
sorbed and converted by collectors
installed in the roof of Chinguetti's
brand new schoolhouse.
Operating five to seven hours a day,
every day, the pump can provide each
of Chinguetti's 3,000 inhabitants with
a daily 20 litres of water, just double
the amount consumed before the pump
was installed.
Before the pump came to Chin¬
guetti, one member of a family would
spend as much as half a day merely
drawing water for the household. Often
the task was delegated to children as
young as six years old.
Drawing water was not a pleasant
task, but the well was one of the
natural centres of community life. For
many Mauritanian children, the things
they saw and the conversations they
heard as they waited their turn at the
well represented an important part of
their general education.
In installing a solar pump was there
not a danger of increasing the water
supply but at the same time drying up
the well of knowledge, of destroying
one of the focal social points of com¬
munity life?
The logical solution? Build a school
with a roof that would act as a solar
energy collector. The well of know¬
ledge would be revived and com¬
munity life invigorated.
Other problems arose. What form
should the new building take? Should
it be a functional building of ultra¬
modern design? Or should an attempt
be made to make it harmonize with
such beautiful existing buildings as
Chinguetti's ancient mosque?
This question resolved itself in the
happiest possible way. A tower was
essential to house the pump and
storage tanks and attached to this
was the school building itself, the roof
of which had to be of simple, rather
flat gable type if it was to fulfil its
role as an energy collector. The build¬
ing was erected by local labour under
the direction of an experienced fore¬
man from Senegal, since the Sene¬
galese are traditionally the expert
masons of west Africa.
The resulting construction, with Its
courtyards, small windows and tower
topped with the traditional protube¬
rances, which guard the building and
Its occupants from danger, blends
perfectly with the age-old buildings of
Chinguetti. What is more, the design
is such that the entire building could
be constructed with local materials.
Some nine months after the com¬
pletion of the pumphouse-school the
pump is smoothly throbbing away
bringing the benediction of water to
3,000 people. Its simple controls are
handled by an unskilled local man.
Only one technical inspection a year
will be required and the designers
hope that the pump will still be throb¬
bing away in 15 or even 20 years time.
School has begun and Chinguetti has
resumed its traditional way of life
relieved of one back-breaking, soul-
destroying labour and with its water
supply doubled.
The story of the Chinguetti pump
began in the early 1960s when the
late Professor Henri Masson, doyen
of the University of Dakar and long¬
time resident in Africa, turned his
attention to the problem of improving
the water supply of this drought-prone
region.
There were, he knew, adequate
reserves of water just 10 to 20 metres
below the surface and nothing, in
theory, could be easier than to dig
new wells or improve old ones and
then instal classic pumps powered by
the tried and trusty diesel engine. The
necessary technology, It seemed,
already existed and was only waiting
to be applied.
But was it the right technology for
this part of Africa? Who would instal

considerable expense from abroad?
How could spare parts and fuel
supplies be transported to remote com¬
munities across these trackless
wastes? What would it all cost?
The questions answered themselves.
The technology was available but it
was the wrong technology. Somehow
a way had to be found of producing
long-life, maintenance-free equipment
and of tapping the only abundant,
locally-available energy source the
sun.
In the laboratories of the Institut
de Physique Météorologique, at Dakar
university, Professor Masson and a
young French engineer, Jean-Pierre
Girardier, rapidly reviewed the classic
methods of solar energy conversion.
The initially attractive notion of
employing direct conversion by means
of silicon solar cells (like those used
to power spacecraft) was soon ruled
out on the grounds of cost.
Next to be considered was con¬
version by means of a high temp¬
erature thermal cycle using focussing
collectors such as parabolic mirrors
which concentrate the sun's rays on
a small receiver capable for example
of producing steam (if you set light to
a piece of paper by focussing the sun's
rays on it with a magnifying glass
you are using the same principle).
The practical difficulties of this
method soon led to its rejection. The
mirrors are bulky and easily damaged
by wind and sand; they have to be
continually adjusted as the sun moves
across the sky; and even small
amounts of cloud reduce their effi¬
ciency considerably.
simpler, more reliable me¬
thod was needed to cope with the
harsh conditions of Africa. The two
men turned their attention to a form of
conversion using fixed, flat-plate
collectors.
The principle behind this solar
energy conversion method is compa¬
ratively simple. Water circulating in
a closed system of pipes running
through flat-plate collectors is heated
by the sun. The heat from this water
causes a liquid gas, such as butane,
to expand rapidly thus building up a
pressure that drives a piston which
in turn drives a pump. The gas then
passes through a condenser where it
is cooled and liquefied by the cold
water pumped up from the well on its
way to the storage tank, and the cycle
is then ready to begin again.
The principle may indeed be simple,
but in practice it calls for a faultlessly
designed, high efficiency engine capa¬
ble of operating with very small temp¬
erature differences. The pump at
Chinguetti, for example will operate
when the temperature of the well water
used for cooling is as high as
35 degrees centigrade and the temp¬
erature of the water in the collectors is
as low as 60 degrees. Simple flat-
plat collectors, however, can easily
produce temperatures of 70 to 75
degrees.
Experiments with a number of
strictly laboratory prototypes with no
possible practical application were
followed by the production of four
practical prototypes all of which are
still in service.
First to be installed, in 1966, was
the "NADJE" pump, to be followed
two years later by the "SEGAL" pump
(both initially Installed at the Institut
de Physique Météorologique de Dakar,
Senegal, though "SEGAL" was later
transferred to a site in the bush).
Then came the "ONERSOL" pump
(installed at Bossey-Bangou, near Nia¬
mey, Niger, and operated under the
expert guidance of Dr. Abdou Mou¬
mouni, Director of the Niger Office of
Solar Energy (ONERSOL) and one of
Africa's leading authorities on solar
energy). In 1971 followed the installa¬
tion of the "OUAGA" pump, at Oua¬
gadougou, Upper Volta, on which the
first experiments in using the thermal
cycle of commercial butane were made.
By this time Jean-Pierre Girardier
was back in France. Working in a
cramped corner of his firm's work¬
shops, he perfected the "Chinguetti"
pump, the first fully operational pump
designed to fit into an integrated cons¬
truction planned in co-operation with
helio-technicians and architects.
In Paris Girardier had made contact
with two architects, M. and Mme
Alexandroff, both teachers at the
Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, where
they were members of the "Groupe
Tiers-Monde" (Third World Group), a
multi-disciplinary teaching group con¬
sisting of architects, engineers, geo¬
graphers, sociologists, etc.
This was a decisive moment in the
pump's development. Not only did
this contact lead to a considerable
increase in the pump's efficiency,
thanks to the development of improved
collectors known as "Canaletas", or
"Solar Gutters", but it also brought
increased emphasis on the economic,
cultural and sociological implications
of introducing a revolutionary techno¬
logy into a remote African community.
Perhaps for the first time ever, a
piece of new technology was being
planned as much round basic socio¬
logical considerations as on technical
imperatives. Indeed, anyone who
really cares about Third World dev¬
elopment, who wants to make sure that
the right technology is used at the
right time, at the right place, in the
right way, might be well advised to
take a trip to Chinguetti to look at a
length of coiled rope and to drink of
the well of knowledge. M
