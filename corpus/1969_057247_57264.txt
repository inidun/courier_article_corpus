Man against Nature - 2
THE DEAD LAND
OF THE WITHERED TREES
D,lEFORESTATION has taken
place from earliest times and is prob¬
ably better documented than most
other types of change of habitat. The
earliest effect of restricted deforesta¬
tion is one of enrichment of the habitat
by providing change in a situation of
little or no change. Parkland in forest
is appreciated by many species of
grazing animals.
Primitive and later man, utterly sur¬
rounded by forest, arrives at a psy¬
chological state eventually when he
must push back the forest and not be
enfolded.
The Anglo-Saxon colonizing a Brit
ain which had islands of ploughland
and pasture connected by roads in a
sea of forest was not only knowled¬
geable in tools and woodwork, but
clever ecologically. To create new
arable ground in the long term he
used a biological plough or grubber
in the oak and beech forest in the
shape of the snouts of herds of
swine, descendants of the European
wild boar. The beasts garnered the
acorns and beech nuts, and by
concentration of effort prevented
regeneration.
As actual tree felling took place,
grass followed on the "cultivation" by
the pigs; grass parklands or lawns
were created, to be ploughed as need¬
ed. In temperate, humid England, the
changed biological system of forest to
grassland with occasional trees made
for little loss of organic matter and the
output of free energy was probably not
far behind that of the forest. Cer¬
tainly it allowed more of it to be
used for producing man's food.
The fact that the export of natural
resources tends to open the way to
devastation has been documented
many times. The oak forests of Eng¬
land did not all fall to the axes
of the early Anglo-Saxons. The rise

of England as a naval power involved
heavy felling, and the use of iron de¬
manded more felling for smelting fuel.
The opening of the 17th century
saw prohibitions on the felling of Eng¬
lish timber. This drove the iron
smelters to the woods of western
Scotland where the long sea lochs
allowed ships laden with iron ore to
penetrate deep into the forests of
Scots pine and to have access to the
oaks down in the glens.
Here devastation came quickly be¬
cause of the high rainfall, acid soils
and steep slopes. The Forestry Com¬
mission of the present day is concern¬
ed with the repair of this damage, but
at great cost because the active humus
has long gone from the once-timber¬
ed slopes.
Perhaps the onslaught on North
American forests was the main reason
for the rise of conservation thinking.
Fairfield Osborn said in 1948 of the
United States, "The story of our nation
in the last century as regards the use
of forests, grasslands, wildlife and
water sources is the most violent and
destructive of any written in the long
history of civilization. The velocity of
events is unparalleled..."
This fact of weight and speed of
destruction may find its absolution in
the rise of the ideal and practice of
conservation in the United States. Si¬
milarly in Africa, there has grown an
awareness of the need to conserve,
often as a result of destruction and
denudation.
On a happier note, the African Spec¬
ial Project carried out jointly by the
International Union for Conservation
of Nature and Natural Resources and
FAO, may well have been the turning
point in attitudes towards conserva¬
tion in the rest of Africa. No less
important was the international confer¬
ence held in Arusha, Tanganyika in
1961, on the need for conservation in
tropical Africa.
The felling of tropical forests has
been a story of sheer extraction. The
massive and impressive accumulation
of organic matter presented by this
oldest life form on the planet tends
to blind us to its fragility.. Like most
forest forms, the tropical is primarily
a photosynthetic factory of cellulose,
with any protein as very secondary
production.
The tropical forest floor has been
protected from the sun for thousands
of years with the niches for decay and
conversion so well filled that nutrition

of the trees and the life of the canopy
are bountiful. When the forest is fell¬
ed the tender soil exposed to the sun
oxidizes rapidly and disappears:
Like snow upon the desert's dusty
face.
Lighting a little hour or two is gone.
The mahogany forests of Hispaniola,
the name by which Haiti was known
after its discovery by Christopher
Columbus, have gone; those of
Honduras are going and the results
are well known.
The world's wetlands are another
habitat sometimes transformed by
man. In general, wetlands are highly
productive of protein in the shape of
animal bodies mammals, birds, fish

A single crumb of soil is a teeming

tiny creatures bacteria, protozoa,
microscopic worms and mites
on whose health, to some extent,
man depends for the successful raising
of crops. This photo of a soil

and invertebrates but not always in
a form acceptable to the human being
as food. Drainage has been done
throughout history in various parts of
the world to create navigable channels
and to provide more agricultural land
or, perhaps, specially fertile agricultur¬
al land. Holland and the Fen country
of England are good examples, as
also are many areas in the U.S.A.
Where the soil is alkaline peat it
becomes highly fertile when dry
enough to manage, but so contracts
in volume that diking and pumping
become necessary, for the won land
is then below the level of the adjoining
sea. The situation is vulnerable and
soil is friable and tends to blow away.
The question must always be
whether the considerable capital
works necessary can be maintained
and whether the potential fertility of
wetland soils can pay for them.
Once more the ecosystem is being
changed from one of protein produc¬
tion to one of largely carbohydrate
grain production. Certainly more
mouths can be fed on the "devaluated"
product. The aesthetic loss of beau¬
tiful species, especially birds, from
drainage in wetlands is considerable.
The United States has changed its
former policy to some extent by
allowing wetlands to refill and resume
their former land form, for example the
Klamath Marshes in northern Califor¬
nia. It might be said here that allowing
marshes to refill is only possible as a
policy in a country affluent enough to
be producing grain surpluses and
where the proteinous wildlife is
beginning to have extrinsic values
for recreation.
The Everglades National Park in
Florida provides a perfect instance of
the complexity of wetland habitats and
what can happen when water is deflect¬
ed from these areas.
The Everglades constitutes a large
national park, but is a vivid example
of several thousand square miles
being insufficient to be an ecologically
independent area. Nothing is simple
when playing with water on wetlands.
General reserve on changing the
nature of wetlands is not yet apparent.
There is a psychological fascination
about playing with water and to change
a protein-producing system to a car¬
bohydrate-producing one seems to
provide ample practical reason for
going ahead.
Africa has many interior wetlands
and one of the most promising lines of
development in recent years has been
improved management and enlarged
use of the fish resources of these
wetlands. Zambia is an excellent
example of achievement of an improved
standard of nutrition for a new in¬
dustrial population from the freshwater
fisheries of the numerous swamps.
Yet the projected increase in human
population has caused serious con¬
sideration of draining such areas as
the Kafue and Chambeshi Flats to
serve as wheat-growing lands. Not
only would fishing be constricted as a
result, but the herds of game animals
would go also, despite the fact that
the red lechwe, an antelope moving
in large herds, is adapted to grazing
inundated lands and potentially capa¬
ble of management as a meat-
producing animal.
I
HE history of over-hunting
selected desirable species is well
known, and concerns us here in so far
as the disappearance or decrease in
numbers of species has altered the
ecosystem and the habitat. We do
not know very much about this; our
knowledge of niche ("microhabitat")
function is growing but we have much
to learn about habitats from which a
niche occupant has been removed.
The elephant would provide a good
comparative study because we have
plenty of habitats from which it has
recently been removed by over-hunting
and others in which it is more
numerous than ever because of pro¬
tection. We have a fair notion of what
is happening In the latter situation
production of grassland and removal
of bush with the tsetse fly being
pushed back. The elephant is the
agent of change, but man's distortion
of the elephant's way of life is the
instigator of change.
Not enough thinking has been done
about the influence of reduction of
plains game on African savanna. The
bison on North American prairies was
followed by the plough, so we know
little of the change which actual
reduction would have caused, except
that on the fringes of prairie there is a
coincident rise of even-age forest.
The wolf is perhaps the best example
of the intentional extincting or eradic¬
ation of animal species because of its
direct challenge to extended pastor-
alism. The supposed behaviour of the.
wolf has become a human psycholo¬
gical fiction which can still influence
the fate of habitats.
In the recent past, bounties were still
given on wolves killed in the Arctic

where human prédation of the caribou
was quite insufficient to prune the cari¬
bou population to safeguard the range
which, if over-grazed, might take a
century to recover longer than cari¬
bou could wait.
There were excellent object lessons
in the reduced reindeer populations on
the west coast of North America
after thirty years of over-grazing of
the ranges," but the psychological
obsession about wolves had blinded
people to the plain cause. These over¬
grazed ranges can still be seen as
different from the surrounding terrain
when viewed from an airplane at
20,000 feet.
How far the lack of the predator was
responsible, or how far the sheer
lowering of numbers of deer was the
cause of the Kaibab plateau crash of
mule deer in 1916 will probably never
be known, but the fact of an absence
of predators was immediately under¬
stood.
What interests us most is the per¬
cussive influence on habitat caused by
violent fluctuations due to the man-
caused absence of predator popul¬
ations which not only lower the
numbers of the herds on which they
prey, but also keep them moving.
Recent work on the moose-wolf ratio
and equilibrium on Isle Royale in Lake
Superior shows how a woodland habi¬
tat carrying these large deer can be
maintained by man allowing the wolf
to do all the necessary culling.
Mineral exploitation and industrial
processing are other factors to be
considered. Smelting liberates toxic
fumes which kill plants and sometimes
animals. The sterilization of areas by
copper smelting in Tennessee is well
known. Aluminium smelting at the foot
of the Great Glen of Scotland produc¬
ed fluoride fumes which were blown
north-eastwards up the glen by the
prevailing south-west winds. The graz-
ings were affected and young cattle
suffered. It took a court case and
very dilatory action thereafter before
scrubbers were installed to remove
the hazard.
The lead mines of Derbyshire and
the felspar workings left areas of spoil
on which the herbage which grew
thereafter was so far impregnated with
lead that young stock could not be
grazed on them. This effect remains in
the ground even centuries after the
mining.
Coal and shale mining not only create
conditions where subsidence occurs,
but large quantities of detritus are
produced which are in general dumped
on the surface near the mine shaft.
These vast dumps not only make the
landscape an unhappy one aesthetic¬
ally, but serious interference with

surface drainage is often apparent in
their vicinity. At worst, these dumps
are a menace to human communities,
as was experienced so tragically at
Aberfan in Wales. We are slowly
emerging into a world of different
values in which space is seen to be
getting short and derelict landscapes
cannot be allowed to impinge on such
a scarce commodity.
The recent marriage of ecology and
landscape architecture has immense
promise. The English counties of Dur¬
ham and Northumberland have initiated
schemes of vegetating pit heaps, with
a success that promises to enrich and
make beautiful the violated landscape.
The National Coal Board of Britain
has done much opencast mining in the
North of England, and immense care is
being taken to rehabilitate the land¬
scape afterwards, to the extent of 11
per cent of the Board's income. Similar
results can be found in Germany.
The strip mining and auger mining of
the hills of Kentucky are leaving eye¬
sores of dereliction along the faces of
the hills, and the effects of watershed
erosion which follow are having serious
repercussions below these hills on the
good soils of the Ohio River country.
It is all the more distressing to hear
that the coal is being mined for sale
at the lowest possible price to that
model of rehabilitation policy, the
Tennessee Valley Authority.
One of our difficulties in much con¬
servation endeavour is to stop differ¬
ent agencies within one nation work¬
ing to each other's disadvantage, never
mind between nations. Once more we
lack good legislation: the process of
law being so largely by precedent, it
can scarcely keep abreast of the types
of change quite unimagined in the past.

MILLIONS OF CORMORANTS live unmolested on the
island of San Lorenzo (below) despite its proximity to
Callao, Peru's busiest port. The guano, or droppings,
of these birds, which have sometimes accumulated
to depths of as much as 150 feet, are one of Peru's
most valuable resources. Guano (annual production
now 300,000 tons) was long ago used by ancient Indian
civilizations to fertilize the irrigated lands of Peru's
coastal desert. For the past 50 years, the
guano-producing islands have been rigorously
protected by the Peruvian Government which has
also cut off several peninsulas from the mainland to
create ten new islands where the birds can breed in
safety. Mass fishing of anchovies the basic food of
the cormorants has been restricted so as to preserve
the ecological balance that makes possible the
production of guano (see the "Unesco Courier",
March. 1966).
