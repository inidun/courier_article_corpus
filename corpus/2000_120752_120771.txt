Te c h n o l o g y,
the artist’s ally
All filmmakers can profit from new technology, says Egyptian director Yousri Nasrallah. The
only trouble is that it may turn distribution networks upside down
EGYPTIAN FILMMAKER, WHOSE LASTFILM
El Medina WAS SHOWN AT THE LOCARNO FESTIVAL (SWITZERLAND) IN
1999
I
made my fourth and latest feature fil m , E l
M e d i n a, in digital video on the streets of Cairo
and in Paris. I was the first Egyptian director to
make a fiction film using this new technique.
After the talkies, colour and the advent of
t e l e v i s i o n , many people see digital video as the
fourth revolution in the history of cinema.
It already has talented aficionados such as Lars
von Trier and the other Danish directors who support
his Dogma statement of film principles.Their watch-
w o r d s : shoot with a camera on your shoulder,use no
a r t i ficial lighting to be as true to life as possible. S u c h
a doctrine could only come from a rich country,w h e r e
creative people need self-imposed restrictions to
flo w e r.We on the other hand have to cope with autho-
ritarian regimes and the dead hand of censorship.
I ’ve given up 35mm cameras not out of principle,b u t
for practical reasons. My budgets won’t allow me to
do otherwise.
No easy images
Pragmatism means first of all not going on about
the film you might have made. Just do it,with every
resource you can lay your hands on. I have only one
r u l e : I must keep my independence. For my fir s t
f e a t u r e,Vols d’Été (Summer Flights),made in 1988,
I wanted a star from the Egyptian big-studio system
to play the wife of a landowner living in the 1950s
who hated [former Egyptian president, G a m a l
Abdel] Nasser. But she just wouldn’t accept the
p a r t . Her fans wouldn’t understand, she said. C h a n-
ging the script would be to lose my independence.
So I shot the film with non-professionals—an archi-
tect,a tourist guide and a journalist.
Whether it’s amateur actors or digital video,
once I’ve accepted the limitations that I haven’t
chosen,I have to sort out the problems they bring.
And that’s what I like.Th a t ’s where creation starts.
Technique is never an artist’s enemy.A painter
will try goache, oil or wash drawing techniques.
You and the cinematographer on a film simply want
the most out of the camera. Unlike 35mm fil m ,
video doesn’t have depth of field:right close up or
very far off, you get the same sharp image.To give
the shots depth,we tried to add as much colour as
p o s s i b l e, using painted walls and brightly-coloured
clothing.And we established the film’s visual style
to suit the story of these people who watch each
other from their balconies.
When a new technology appears, we often start
by asking the wrong questions. Digital video is
c h e a p e r,so will it lower artistic standards? Not at all.
The invention of the pencil didn’t lead to standar-
dized literature. Young directors have to unders-
tand that there are no such things as easy images,
only a less costly way to tackle problems. But the fear
that new techniques will make things uniform is
u n d e r s t a n d a b l e. Digital video has given rise to a
fashion that says because the cameras are light, y o u
ought to run all over the place.But do you remember
Julien Duvivier’s film The Great Wa l t z? The camera
was big as a wardrobe, but it spun round with the
greatest of ease because the film required it to.L i k e-
w i s e, a video film sometimes requires fixed shots.
Doubts about new technology tend to centre on
distribution,because there is talk of cinemas sho-
wing films beamed in by satellite. For big fil m s,
shown in thousands of cinemas, this method is jus-
t i fie d .But the telecommunications giants are trying
to secure a monopoly. So what will happen then to
all the “little” films produced in poor countries?
The power of technology, h o w e v e r, a l w a y s
reaches a limit. For many years, we were cut off
from each other by television and its production
methods. All of us: viewers, producers and script -
w r i t e r s.But look at the credits of Fe l l i n i ’s or Yo u s s e f
Chahine’s films from the 1950s. There were many
authors—people who wanted to meet each other
and talk about life and fil m s. It was wonderful.
Today young filmmakers are rubbing shoulders,
working together and fighting against such isolation.
The same desire is there.And that goes for me too.
Every film I make, I want to get as many people
together as I can. ■
