tj HE present situation in theworld and the outlook for 
last quarter of the 20th century
seem to me to show that Unesco, as
it attains its 30th year, has just as
important a mission to fulfil as when
it was founded at the end of the
Second World War.
Unesco's original and essential
function, which ultimately is an ethical
one, is still in fact to contribute to
peace by promoting international co-
operation in education, science, cul-
ture and communication.
The dangers to which world peace
is exposed are in evidence every day.
But we know, too, that there are other
threats, in some cases resulting from
the very powers which science and
technology have given to mankind :
natural resources are being exploi-
ted without order or control, our envi-
ronment is deteriorating, the inequali-
ties between countries or groups of
countries, and indeed within certain
countries, are becoming intolerable,
and misunderstandings between cul-
tures are deepening despite, or per-
haps even because of, the rising flood
of information, which sometimes looks
as if it is going to submerge us.
I am therefore convinced that, to
ward off these dangers, it is essential
to engage in a joint, wor) d-wide effort
of reflection on where our civilizations
are heading.
Unesco has a duty to take part in
this reflection in depth, which should
be its foremost obligation. Unesco's
particular vocation as an international
organization is to be a forum for those

skills-which Unesco can secure from
the international community only if it
is a lively centre for carrying out
studies and pooling ideas-the actual
work involved in promoting develop-
ment affords opportunities for intellec-
tual and cultural exchanges, so that
eventually no fundamental difference
between intellectual co-operation and
operational action can be clearly dis-
cerned.
But above all, I am convinced that
the problem of development is insep-
arable from a whole complex of matters
considered as relating to intellectual
life, We cannot accept the picture,
inspired by a facile idealism, of
Unesco on the one hand devoting
some of its efforts to scientific and
cultural co-operation and the world of
ideas, in the hope that such co-oper-
ation will further the spirit of peace in
the world, and on the other addressing
itself to the task of improving the
situation of the least privileged.
The distinguishing feature of the
world today seems to me, on the
contrary, to be the close interdepen-
dence between all its parts, wall the
regions composing it, all the human
groups living in it. Development is
therefore not a problem peculiar to a
certain number of countries. It is a
world problem, because its significance
is something involving a global com-
plex of relationships and mechanisms,
a certain kind of order or disorder.
It is a concept applicable alike to
the prospects of the industrialized
countries, wondering about the future
of their growth and its effects on living
conditions, and to the longing for a
better life in the countries of the Third
Wor ! d.
It is a unifying concept in the
domain of theory, even though it may
cover the most serious disparities
between human groups and between
individuals, and as such, more than
any other, it implicitly calls for human
solidarity, that solidarity whose ab-
solute necessity I stressed on taking
office as Director-General of Unesco,
pointing out that it presupposes not
only the acceptance of differences
between individuals and between
cultures but also concerted efforts to
achieve justice and progress for all.
I have dwelt on the question of
development in this way partly no
doubt because it is central to our
preoccupations, but also because it
appears to me to provide an excellent
illustration of some of the major
problems affecting the future of
mankind and necessitating a concerted
approach on the part of the inter-
national community if they are to be
solved.
