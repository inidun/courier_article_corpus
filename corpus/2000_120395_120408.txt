were accepted by the Cabinet,and since 1996,the
government has stopped giving new licenses. For
probably the first time, a fishing community changed
the policy of globalization through protest.
Your movement has also expressed particular
concern over shrimp production for export.
First of all, you have to ask why aquacultures
[ s h rimp fa rms] exist. I t ’s because a particular va ri e t y
like shri m p, cuttle fish or salmon is already depleted,
and is no longer available in the marine sector. B u t
the ve ry fact that it is a monoculture means trouble,
because it depends on a high use of pesticides and
a rt i ficial manure.This pollutes the entire area.T h e n
the paddy-fields,which are meant for the people’s
basic needs, are conve rt e d . Then the mangr ove s
are destroye d , though they are the breeding gr o u n d
for many species. By bringing in saline water, you
pollute the drinking water meant for local people.
The entire development [around 200,000 hectares
of coastal land have been converted into shrimp
fa rms] is displacing coastal people and fishing com-
m u n i t i e s. And all this intensive aquaculture of
shrimps is controlled by big companies,big inves-
t o rs and big rich people—and funded by the Wo r l d
Bank.It is a philosophy of rape and run: you make
the money fast,then you run away.
In 1996, the Supreme Court ordered all the aqua-
culture fa rms in the country to be abolished. But instead
of abolishing them,the gove rnment and political part i e s
sided with the World Bank and multinational companies,
and ordered a review of the judgement.They then intro-
duced a new Aquaculture A u t h o rity bill, which is pen-
ding approval by the Upper House of Pa r l i a m e n t .F i s h e r-
people are ve ry angry about this.
How has the experience of Indian fishermen
differed from that of other fishing communities
around the world?
Whether in India, the U. S . or Europe, s m a l l
b o ats and small communities have no chance of sur-
vival.Everywhere the pattern is the same:only the
big will survive,and the rest will be wiped out.
But globalizat i o n ’s victims can change the situa-
t i o n . From Senegal to Brazil, from Canada to South
A f ri c a , fis h e rpeople are struggling against destru c-
tive fishing and the stronghold of multinationals.
Local communities should be the custodians of
this natural capital. ■

The last ten years have been marked by a series of
protests by fisherpeople across India, in which you
have been deeply involved. Why are fishing
communities so angry?
In 1991 India introduced its new economic
policy, which marked the beginning of a new deep
sea fishing policy. Huge foreign ve s s e l s , wo r k i n g
under the guise of joint ventures and fees paid to the
g ove rn m e n t , were gi ven licenses and started coming
into Indian wat e rs.There are some 25,000 such ve s-
sels around the world.They have depleted all the
oceans apart from the Indian Ocean, and are a
t h r e at to over 100 million people in deve l o p i n g
countries who depend on fisheries for their liveli-
h o o d . So this new policy was clearly going to affect
Indian fisherpeople, and probably displace them.
Ten million fis h e rpeople went on four all-India
s t ri k e s.The gove rnment appointed the Murari com-
m i t t e e , which made  21 recommendations aimed at
changing the entire deep sea fishing policy. These
