‘I’ll go to parliament dressed as I was during my
c a m p a i g n , in an ove r c o at and a head-scarf. N o
way will I put on the chador.” Elaheh Koulaï, a
u n i ve rsity professor elected to parliament as a repre-
s e n t at i ve of Tehran in the Fe b ru a ry 18, 2000 legi s l a-
t i ve elections, unleashed a political storm when she
made this quasi-revo l u t i o n a ry proclamat i o n . S i n c e
the advent of the Islamic Republic in 1979,all wo m e n
holding official positions have wo rn the chador, t h e
l o n g,black fa b ric cove ring that conceals the entire body
from head to toe.
Marzieh Dabagh, an outgoing member of parlia-
ment who was not re-elected, reacted to Koulaï’s sta-
tements by threatening to “ b ox the ears ”of any wo m a n
who would dare come to the M a j l i s (the Iranian par-
liament) without the traditional chador.The brother
of the Guide of the Islamic Republic, Hadi Kha-
m e n e i , a leading member of the reformist camp,h a d
to step in and cool tempers dow n , s aying that all
f o rms of ve i l s , from the simple head-scarf to the
c h a d o r , are acceptable.
This debate may seem tri t e , but it reveals the
a s s e rt i veness of women in Iranian society, i n c l u d i n g
outside Te h r a n , where they are seldom seen without
the chador. Fatemeh Khatami (no relation to the pre-
sident) was elected to parliament in Mashhad,not fa r
from the Afghan border, e ven though she does not
wear the chador, an unprecedented event in the pro-
v i n c e s.
An educated generation
A symbol of the Islamic order,the obligation to we a r
the veil has never prevented women from standing
up for their ri g h t s.At the beginning of the revo l u t i o n ,
the gove rnment tried to send them back into the
h o m e , p ri m a rily with offers of early retirement and
i n c e n t i ves to work less.But officials soon gave up in the
face of resistance (women were accustomed to gentler
t r e atment under the Shah, especially if they belonged
to the elite) and the needs of the country, then at wa r
with Iraq.To d ay,women account for 12 per cent of the
work force.Although the figure is the same as in 1979,
it is likely to rise as new generations of better-educat e d
women enter the labour market.
For women have taken full advantage of the literacy
for all campaign launched after the revo l u t i o n ,e s p e-
cially in the country s i d e , which had remained back-
ward under the Shah.To d ay the percentage of girls in
school is almost the same as that of boys (nearly 80 per
c e n t ) .Young women account for 40 per cent of uni-
ve rsity students and, t wo ye a rs ago, for the first time
more girls than boys were admitted to the competitive
n ational entrance examinat i o n s.This ye a r , they eve n
make up 58 per cent of the accepted candidat e s.
“Almost all leisure activities are closed to gi r l s ,”
explains law yer and wo m e n ’s rights advo c ate Meh-
ranguiz Kar. “So they focus on their studies.”
Women are still overwhelmingly underr e p r e s e n t e d
in political decision-making bodies, but they play a
d e c i s i ve role as vo t e rs.“Their turn-out has been outs-
tanding since the May 1997 legi s l at i ve ballot, w h i c h
helped elect President Khat a m i ,” continues Kar.“ T h e
wo m e n ’s vote is a conscious vo t e . They carefully
choose candidates who are in favour of their ri g h t s.”
In Fe b ru a ry 1999,they made use of their power to vo t e
some 300 women into municipal councils during the
first local elections since 1979. In the rather traditional

p r ovincial cities and tow n s , these results reflect a
“ r e volution of mentalities”, s ays Fatemeh Ja l a ï p o u r , a
Tehran municipal council member responsible for
wo m e n ’s issues.
The wo m e n ’s vote also helped reform e rs win the
l e gi s l at i ve elections. Some interior ministry officials say
t h at women outnumbered men vo t e rs : 55 per cent
compared with 45 per cent. B u t , as journalist Saïd
Leylaz points out,“this time they didn’t vote specific a l l y
for women candidat e s ,” e ven though their number
increased by 70 per cent compared with the last legi s-
l at i ve elections. Like the outgoing M a j l i s, the new par-
liament has only fifteen women deputies (out of 290),
but they are moderates rather than conservat i ve s.
A voice in the press
Women must still settle for a backseat in politics,bu t
they hold a gr owing number of senior civil serv i c e
p o s i t i o n s. Since taking office in 1997, P r e s i d e n t
Mohammad Khatami has asked his ministers to appoint
women to head up the va rious ministerial depart-
m e n t s.And his brother, Mohammad Reza Khat a m i ,
who leads the Islamic Iran Pa rt i c i p ation Front,said after
t h at movement won the last elections, “ We are in
favour of women entering the gove rn m e n t .”
The rise of Iranian women is partly due to their
own mobilization effort s. After the Iran-Iraq wa r ,
m a ny of them organized all kinds of activities within
r e l i gious organizat i o n s , often spurred on by the
g ove rn m e n t . Since 1997, they have rushed into the
l i b e r a l i z ation process begun by Mohammad Kha-
tami to set up more independent non-gove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z at i o n s , despite resistance from conservat i ve s ,
who until now have controlled the committee in
charge of issuing perm i t s.To d ay, the social fa b ric is
p a rtly based on wo m e n .“In Te h r a n ,s e veral hundred
grassroots mutual aid, e nvironmental protection and
other groups are headed by wo m e n ,” s ays Ja l a ï p o u r.
L i k e w i s e , the number of young women on student
councils is steadily on the ri s e .A n d ,s ays Kar, wo m e n
head over 40 publishing companies, most of which
p rint books on wo m e n ’s issues or by women authors.
The press has also played a key role. As early as
1 9 9 0 , women Muslim intellectuals founded the
monthly Z a n a n (Wo m e n, in Fa rs i ) , where they cam-
paign for a revision of their legal status and a more
m o d e rn form of Islam.They are demanding the same
rights as men with regard to inheritance (under shari a ,
they are entitled to only half as much as men),d i vo r c e
(they can be repudiated for no apparent reason) and
child custody (which is denied them if their daughter
is over seven and their son over two ) . Only a few
minor touch-ups have been made in the past seve r a l
ye a rs to correct these inequalities. For example, a
woman may now request that her right to ask for a
d i vorce be recognized in the marriage contr a c t .
Widely read by young wo m e n ,Z a n a n boasts a cir-
c u l ation of 30,000,one of the highest runs of any Ira-
nian monthly. H owe ve r , there as elsewhere, t h e
d e b ate over the interp r e t ation of Islamic rules still
d o m i n ates the issue of gender equality, which limits
the scope of the feminist move m e n t .“ A d vo c ates of
s e c u l a rism still cannot organize as such,” s ays Kar.
They have voiced their concerns on several occasions
within non-gove rnmental groups such as the Orga-
n i z ation of Women Jo u rnalists and through the
wo m e n ’s press, in Z a n a n and the daily Z a n, before it
was shut down less than one year ago.
“ We ’re going to have new laws passed in favo u r
of gender equality,” said Elaheh Koulaï after she
won the election. The deputy’s determ i n ation is
likely to put her on a collision course with irat e
c o n s e rvat i ve s , who view the “loosening of moral
s t a n d a r d s ” as a sign of their political defeat . ■
