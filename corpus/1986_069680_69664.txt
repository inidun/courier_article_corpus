World military spending: over $1.5 million a minute
In the developing world, 800 million people
live in absolute poverty and deprivation. 500
million are malnourished. Many millions have
no access to safe drinking-water and do not
have the income necessary to purchase food.
It has been estimated that there are more than
50,000 nuclear warheads in the world. The
total explosive power of the world stock of
nuclear weapons is about equal to one mil¬
lion times that of the Hiroshima bomb, which
had a yield of 13 kilotons. (A kiloton is equal
to 1,000 tons of conventional high explosive
or TNT; a megaton is equal to 1,000,000 tons
of TNT.)
According to a recent United Nations study
on conventional disarmament, the world
arsenal of conventional weapons includes
well over 140,000 main battle tanks, over
35,000 combat aircraft, over 21,000 helicop¬
ters, over 1 ,1 00 major surface warships, plus
more than 700 attack submarines. Approx¬
imately four fifths of the total world military
expenditure is estimated to be devoted to
conventional weapons and armed forces.
It has been estimated that some 1 50 conflicts
fought with conventional weapons have
occurred since the Second World War. It is
impossible to determine with any accuracy
the death toll arising from these conflicts. A
recent United Nations study on conventional
disarmament, however, gives an estimate of
20 million deaths.
Military expenditures represent a significant
share of the public finances of developed and
developing countries. In both cases, they
come to represent an average of some 20 per
cent of governmental expenditures. Accord¬
ing to some estimates, in the developed
countries military spending is about equal to
public expenditure on education or health; in
the developing countries it equals three
times the public expenditure on health and is
a third more than the public expenditure on
education.
Worldwide military expenditures in 1983
amounted to some $800,000 million, accord¬
ing to the most reliable estimates available,
which is the equivalent of more than $1.5
million per minute. In constant prices, this is
more than double the expenditures for 1960
and almost four times those for 1 949. At this
rate it takes just 15 days and 15 hours for
world military expenditure to reach the
$34,300 million spent in the whole of 1 983 for
all official development assistance for all de¬
veloping countries. A recent United Nations
study emphasized that, if recent trends
should persist, the world military expendi¬
ture could reach or exceed $1 ,000,000 million
a year, in current dollars, well before 1990.
Developed countries spent 20 times as much
on military expenditures as they provide for
economic aid.
70 per cent of world military spending is by
the six major military powers, 15 per cent by
other industrialized countries, and the re¬
maining 1 5 per cent by developing countries.
$1 ,000 million dollars =28,000 jobs in military
goods and services, or 57,000 jobs in person¬
al consumption industries, or 71,000 jobs in
education.
For every soldier the average world military
expenditure is $20,000. For every school-age
child the average public education expendi¬
ture is $380.
For every 100,000 people in the world there
are 556 soldiers, but only 85 doctors.
Just one fifth of annual arms expenditures
could abolish world hunger by the year 2000.
