GREENWATCH Water:
will be there
enough?

Humankind has a special
relationship with water. In
every civilization, the most ancient
traditions associate this precious
resource with the origins of life,
purification and regeneration. Far
from being a mere raw material
such as oil, water is vital for life,
indispensable to the economy and so
rich in symbolic value that it trig¬
gers passionate responses. "All the
computers in the world will never be
able to express the real perception
of the value of water or codify the
interactions between it and peo¬
ples," says Andras Szöllösi-Nagy,
director of UNESCO's Division of
Water Sciences and secretary of
the International Hydrological Pro¬
gramme (IHP). "But that is pre¬
cisely UNESCO's role to tackle an
issue that involves science, culture,
education and communication."
For decades, experts have been
making grim forecasts that the
Earth will start running out of
water and that conflicts over this
precious liquid will erupt into
wars. The situation is indeed
alarming. In the first half of 1998,
two international conferences on
the world's water resources took
place at UNESCO Headquarters in
Paris. The theme of the first, orga¬
nized by the French government
and held in March, was Water and
Sustainable Development. The sec¬
ond, in June, was jointly organized
by UNESCO and the International
Association of Hydrological Sci¬
ences and entitled "Water: A
Looming Crisis?" Both events took
stock of current knowledge, and
participants discussed ways of cop¬
ing with the problem.
IIow much water is there in the
earth's reserves? Highly expensive
probes have been sent to the moon,
Mars and the satellites of Jupiter
and Saturn to find out whether
there is water on them, but we still
lack accurate data about the
earth's hydrological resources.
Such information would help to
provide a clearer picture of the
future and, especially, to foresee
the global repercussions of demo¬
graphic and climate change.
One thing we know about water
is that there is plenty of it. The
total volume is put at 1.4 billion
cubic kilometres which could be
imagined as a 2,650-metre-deep
layer of liquid evenly distributed
over the entire surface of the
planet. But 98% of it is saltwater,
mainly in the oceans and seas. Most
of the earth's fresh water is trapped
in the polar ice caps. Less than 1%
of it is available in lakes, rivers and
shallow, easily-accessible aquifers.
These water resources are con¬
stantly in flux. Water from the
oceans and land evaporates into the
atmosphere before falling again as
rain or snow, nourishing plants and
swelling rivers that flow into the
sea. It also seeps through the
ground and percolates down to
aquifers. Very deep groundwater,
known as fossil wa ter, is impervious
to seepage and not renewable.

In the industrialized countries,
all you have to do is turn a tap and
before you know where you are
you've used a considerable amount
of water up to 600 litres per per¬
son a day in the United States. In
hot developing countries, where
shanty-towns on the edges of cities
are crowded with growing numbers
of migrants from the rural areas, a
spigot and two litres of water a day
are a luxury. "In the 1950s," says
Mahmoud Abu-Zeid, president of
the World Water Council, "only a
few countries had this problem. But
in the late 1990s, water is scarce in
26 countries where 300 million peo¬
ple live. Forecasts for 2050 indi¬
cate that 66 countries with approx¬
imately two-thirds of the world's
population will experience a mod¬
erate to severe water shortage."
Over 1.3 billion people received
improved drinking water services
and some 750 million got better san¬
itation facilities during the Inter¬
national DrinkingWater Supply and
Sanitation Decade (1980-1990).
But, says Mr. Abu-Zeid, approxi¬
mately 1.2 billion people still have
no access to drinkingwater and2.9
billion lack sanitation. The resulting

water-borne diseases take the lives
of five million people a year, most
of them children.
Farming and manufacturing
account for most of the world's
water consumption, far outdistanc¬
ing human needs. Of the 3,240 km3
of fresh water drawn every year, says
the World Resources Institute, only
8% are used for human consump¬
tion. Each year fewer than ten coun¬
tries use 60% of the world's 40,000
billion m3 of surface and ground¬
water. Lastly, per capita consump¬
tion rises with the standard of living,
ranging from 260 litres a day per
person in Israel to 200 in Europe,
70 for a Palestinian on the West
Bank and 30 in Africa.
THE DANGERS
OF IRRIGATION
Demand runs highest in places
where irrigation is indispensable,
such as central Asia, Iraq, Iran,
Pakistan, Madagascar and also in
some industrially developed coun¬
tries such as the United States.
Farming accounts for two-thirds
of the total water resources used
by humans a figure that rises to
80% in the Southern countries.
Developing countries consume
twice as much water per hectare of
irrigated land as industrialized
nations, yet their production is
three times lower.
Because of the heat, half the
water evaporates in storage areas
(1 m3 per 8 m3 at the Aswan dam
in Egypt, for example) or when
flowing through open-air irrigation
canals. Poorly-conceived irrigation
projects lead to deterioration of
the soil, as French geographer and
drought expert Monique Mainget
demonstrates , using two examples .
The first is Pakistan. During
the first half of the twentieth cen¬
tury, 10 million hectares were
abundantly irrigated in the Indus
plain. Waterlogging caused by irri¬
gation, combined with a high rate
of evaporation, has led to saliniza-
tion of the soil, making it unpro¬
ductive. The second example, the
Aral Sea in the former Soviet
Union, is different but the result is
the same. Much of the water from
the Syrdarya and Amu Darya rivers
that flow into the huge lake has
been diverted to feed 180,000 km
of irrigation canals, only 12% of
which have been made watertight.
The rivers' flow is considerably
restricted and the Aral Sea is dry¬
ing up. "Irrigation for agricultural
purposes is expensive," Ms.
Mainguet says. "To make it prof¬
itable, farmers must use massive
amounts of pesticides, herbicides
and fertilizer on increasingly
exhausted soil. The impact of pes¬
ticides on health has been over¬
looked. The child morbidity and
mortality rates are among the
world's highest."
The Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations
(FAO) says that 10 to 20% of the
water used for agricultural pur¬
poses could be saved with more
efficient irrigation methods. One
case in point is the foggaras,
underground canals which have
been used since ancient times in
Iran, Chile and the oases of North
Africa, to carry water from wells

located many kilometres away.
Another is the modern under¬
ground drop-by-drop technique
used in Israel. But how can the
water needs of the planet's 240
million hectares of irrigated farm¬
land be realistically met?
Industry is less greedy than
agriculture, but it still consumes
23% of the planet's available
freshwater resources. Michel
Bâtisse, a UNESCO adviser on the
environment, says it is primarily
used for three purposes: "cooling,
production (as part of the prod¬
uct's composition or for process¬
ing) and heating (to make steam or
ensure the smooth running of the
manufacturing process). These cat¬
egories differ widely in terms of
both consumption and pollution."
Untreated waste water is still
commonly discharged into the envi¬
ronment, especially in poor coun¬
tries. But the number of antipollu¬
tion projects and water treatment
plants is on the rise, particularly to
stem effluents from pulp mills and
nitrogen and phosphorus run-off
from the food processing industry.
Manufacturers are especially care¬
ful to take the necessary precau-
44
tions when the "polluter pays"
principle is applied.
COSTS FOR THE CONSUMER
With water consumption rising
twice as fast as population growth,
the idea of free water for all is
increasingly unrealistic. This pre¬
cious, shared resource must have a
price, and it should be based on a
sliding scale to ease the burden on
the needy. Even a nominal cost dis¬
courages waste. French President
Jacques Chirac says it would take
at least $400 billion to fund the
facilities needed to cover priority
water needs over the next ten years
worldwide. But "neither taxes, nor
development aid will be enough,
even though solidarity is a duty."
Consumers must help pay dis¬
tribution costs, while facilities are
financed by local communities and
international aid. But this is assum¬
ing that equipment is standard¬
ized. In Senegal alone, nearly 800
pumping stations are equipped
with 62 different types of motors
and 67 different kinds of pumps.
It is easy to imagine the logistical
nightmare of storing spare parts.
Another problem is that

experts' analysis of needs based on
scientific data are often quite dif¬
ferent from the actual require¬
ments of users, whose conception
of water is shaped by their own
culture, manage it according to
their own ethics of sharing and pro¬
tect and use it according to their
own development needs. Very
often, there is a lack of communi¬
cation between government offi¬
cials, users' organizations and non¬
governmental partners. Poorly
understood water resources man¬
agement has an immediate nega¬
tive impact on a community's bal-

anee and cohesiveness, penalizing
women most of all because they
are responsible for fetching water
in many developing countries.
A case in point is Maharashtra ,
India, where a boom in sugar cane
production led to an increase in the
number of deep wells for irrigation.
Shallower wells for domestic con¬
sumption ran dry and the women
were forced to trudge long dis¬
tances in search of water, adding
considerably to their burden of
chores. In Misalai, Tanzania, more
women than men volunteered to dig
the trenches for a water supply pro¬
ject. But when the pipes were laid,
the network went only to the part of
the village where local leaders lived.
The women decided to stop par¬
ticipating in other development
activities for as long as the water
was not fairly distributed. Their
reaction is all the more under¬
standable since African women
spend an average of six hours a day
in search of water.
SPRINGS OF WAR?
On the Pacific Ocean island of
Tonga, women who had formed
their own environmental and health
affairs organization boycotted a
community sanitation project when
the men's committee and the devel¬
opment agency did not involve them
in its planning and management.
Learning from the experience,
neighbouring villages invited both
men and women to meetings. Each
time project managers, for the sake
of convenience, consult only men,
the consequences can be dramatic.
Men try to appropriate women's land
when irrigation drives up its value.
The women, deprived of their
source of income and their inde¬
pendence, can no longer shop at the
market, with the result that the
children suffer from malnutrition.
This has happened in western
Kenya and northern Afghanistan.
In cities, large amounts of water
go to waste in drinking water dis¬
tribution networks. It is estimated
that 10% is lost due to leaks in
the industrialized countries, a fig
ure that may be as high as 60% in
the developing nations. Industrial
waste, pollution from non-point
sources and lack of sanitation seri¬
ously affect municipal water
resources. The situation is exac¬
erbated by unauthorized connec¬
tions to the supply network and
the failure of some customers to
pay their bills. Meters encourage
consumers to save water, but they
have not yet come into widespread
use around the world. Improving
urban water supplies is a major
challenge for tomorrow. Fifteen
mega-cities already have a popu¬
lation of 10 to 20 million, and their
number is exported to double over
the next two decades.
Jean-Marc Flores of the FAO
says we already consume half the
planet's available water resources
and demand will outstrip supply by
2025, when the world's population
hits 8.3 billion. After that, it will
be necessary to introduce water-sav¬
ing measures or tap reserves of fos¬
sil groundwater provided they
have not already been over-
exploited. Further complicating the
issue is the fact that there are 215
international rivers, as well as
approximately 300 groundwater
basins and underground aquifers
shared by several countries.
Some rivers, such as the
Mekong, Paraguay and Senegal, are
good examples ofjoint management
of a shared resource. But there are
at least 70 water-related flashpoints
in Africa , the Middle East and Latin

America. No country has actually
gone to war over water yet. But a
set of factors including demo¬
graphics, rising demand resulting
from improved living standards , the
predominance of upstream over
downstream the first-served con¬
trol the flow of rivers may stoke
smouldering conflicts.
In medieval Europe, kings had
the right to "use and abuse" water,
which was a private possession and
a source of wealth. Those days are
over. The right to use this increas¬
ingly scarce resource must be part
of a community perspective. That is
why UNESCO Director-General Fed¬
erico Mayor has made an appeal for
"a new water ethics demonstrating
our awareness of the need for fair
distribution, partnership and,
beyond that, sharing."
