Staying power:
a Russian tale
In a town of 40,000 souls, a school has managed to keep up standards on a shoe
string, while in Moscow, a trailblazing principal ploughs along with his
alternative approach to learning, attracting both criticism and curiosity
glasnost (freedom) and perestroika
(rebuilding) hastened the collapse of
communism in 1991 and a new flush of
educational freedom swept through Russia.
But the chaos of Boris Ye l t s i n ’s liberal
experiment brought poverty, u n c e r t a i n t y
and a collapse of central authority that
eroded many of the new liberties offered.
Tatiana Sergeyevna saw her standard of
living plummet along with the real value of
her wages when they were paid on time
and a host of problems arise she could
never have foreseen back in the Soviet
U n i o n ’s twilight years of the mid-1980s.
Vladimir Putin’s surprise ascendancy to
the Kremlin a year ago has changed
n o t h i n g, she says.
To d a y,Tatiana Sergeyevna,her director
Vyatcheslav Sashenkov and the other
3 8 members of staff, do the best they can
with the bare minimum of resources to
maintain educational standards at a school
considered one of the best in the town of
40,000 people.
Per capita funding for the school’s
6 9 0 pupils is a paltry two roubles a day,
about $50 a day for the entire school.H e r
monthly salary is 1,500 roubles ($56), t h e

TTatiana Sergeyevna Korobovtseva works
hard to keep her spirits up despite the
constant and chronic challenges of teaching
in the small railway-junction town of
Rtishchevo in the region of Saratov,
6 5 0 kilometres away from Moscow.
At 40, she is the deputy director of
Secondary School No. 2 and looks back
over a career that spans the entire recent
epoch of upheaval and change in Russia.
Mikhail Gorbachev had only just come to
power when she started teaching and the
Communist Party line still dictated much of
the curriculum. G o r b a c h e v ’s policies of
Role-playing:at Moscow’s School for Self Determination, students and their teacher bring Antiquity to life.

school director’s a dollar more. Many of the
children come from families with lower
incomes or with only one parent. A paid-
for canteen service helps ensure most
children get a hot meal at lunchtime for
three roubles (about 10 U. S. cents) a
s e r v i n g. A board of trustees made up of
p a r e n t s, heads of local enterprises and
teachers raises money to help the school
and the poorest students, but the lack of up-
to-date teaching materials, textbooks and
computers remains sorely felt.
Many have left teaching in the last
decade to go into business or to work as
“shuttle traders” living off the slender
p r o fits to be had from buying cheap goods
in Turkey or Poland and selling them at a
small mark-up in Russia. Those who
remain tend to be the dedicated ones or
those with nowhere else to go.When asked
why she stays on, Tatiana Sergeyevna’s
answer is both typical and revealing. “ I
love my job and could not conceive of life
without teaching. It is a quality of all
Russians that we are used to fighting for
our survival and using laughter and
humour to get through,” she says.
Humour is especially essential for
Tatiana Sergeyevna, a math and computer
s p e c i a l i s t . She has never had the
opportunity to use the Internet and can
only teach programming in theory because
the school’s 13-year-old Soviet-made
computers have been declared a health
hazard due to their high level of electro-
magnetic radiation emissions.“I try not to
talk about the Internet very much with
the children and instead set them tasks to
be solved using algorithms. They write
programmes in their exercise books. I have
to make do with this,” she says.
Her director Vyatcheslav Sashenkov
laughs hollowly when told the Fe d e r a l
Education Ministry plans to train hundreds
of thousands of teachers in using the
Internet and to provide every school in
the country with at least one worldwide
web-connected computer within the next
d e c a d e.“In the entire school there is only
one student who has her own personal
computer and the nearest Internet provider
is in Saratov, 200 kilometres away. Th e
regional governor Dmitri Ay a t s k o v
provides money for computers whenever
a new school is built, but that still leaves
existing ones without the means to provide
proper computing facilities.”
But it would be wrong to picture life at
School No. 2 as all doom and gloom. Th e
academic freedoms ushered in after 1991
have given new scope and vigour to the
c u r r i c u l u m . National guidelines for core
subjects such as Russian language, h i s t o r y
and math leave much choice in other areas.
Teachers are free to devise their own
l e s s o n plans and optional subjects for after-
hours tutoring with a liberty unknown in
Soviet times.
When parents need ex t ra
hands to help out
During the first flush of freedom in the
early 1990s the school offered a wide range
of “fashionable options”as Sashenkov puts
i t : extra English courses, d a n c i n g, c h e s s,
computing (using the then not-quite-so
ancient computers now ruled out of
b o u n d s ) , cultural studies.The teaching day
stretched up to eight hours across six-day
w e e k s. But financial difficulties and, m o r e
recently health concerns, have curtailed
this enthusiastic activity.The regional State
Epidemic Centre ruled that children
cannot attend more than six hours of
classes a day and the school week has been
curbed to five days.
Extra tuition, particularly for those
about to take university entrance exams,
are provided on a paid-for basis—one way
teachers can add a little to their poor
s a l a r i e s.A partnership between the school
and two universities—the technical and
agrarian—in the regional capital Saratov,
means brighter students can study in
lyceum (upper secondary) classes to
prepare for college entrance.
The school has its problems: truancy,
often supported by parents who need extra
hands to help out on the market stall,for
e x a m p l e, is a growing challenge. B u t
despite the financial diffic u l t i e s, which are
common to all schools in the state sector,
particularly those far from Moscow,
Tatiana Sergeyevna does not bemoan her
lot in life. “In defence of a provincial
s c h o o l ,we think that the process of decay
is less pernicious here than in more urban
areas. We have fewer unruly parents and
pupils and hardly any cases of alcoholism
or drug use among our students.”
In Moscow, Alexander Tu b e l s k y ’s
School for Self-Determination might as
well be on another planet, despite the fact
that is also state-funded.This experimental
school has frequently found itself at odds
with educational orthodoxy, both under
communism and the post-Soviet order. N o
stranger to the financial constraints
encountered in the provinces, Tu b e l s k y ’s
battles have been more about intellectual
and pedagogical independence.
The educational philosophy at the
school in the Izmailovo district of north-
eastern Moscow rests as much on a rich
domestic vein of alternative approaches to
teaching and learning as it does on examples
from overseas, notably Britain’s Summerhill
and the free school movement of A . S. N e i l l .
Children and their unique abilities,a p t i t u d e s
and needs are at the centre of the school’s
p h i l o s o p h y. Freedom of choice in subjects,

lesson plans and, y e s, attendance are all
guaranteed under an impressive school
c o n s t i t u t i o n . “ I t ’s a myth that a child needs
to learn a certain set range of subjects in
order to complete his education and be a
successful member of society,” s a y s
Tu b e l s k y, an expressive man with a thick
mop of white hair, who has just turned 60.
“But if a child has spent his school life
learning to find information and to use it for
his clearly set goals; if he has learnt to
communicate and cooperate with others
and to understand the nature of what he is
r e a d i n g, then in the process he has acquired
and developed abilities that may be applied
to whatever he subsequently needs in life.”
With no legally established standards to
meet other than minimum time
requirements for certain core subjects, t h e
school is able to offer its 1,000 pupils and
2 0 0 kindergarten children an academic
freedom theoretically available to any in
R u s s i a .
Staunch opposition
to testing and ra n k i n g
The activities of nearly 80 sixth
graders—children aged 11 and 12 on a
wintry Saturday afternoon—offer a
glimpse into how Tu b e l s k y ’s school, n o w
in its 13th year of innovation, w o r k s.Th e
children are studying ancient civilizations,
as their art-work and displays from fie l d
trips to archaeological sites in the Crimea
in the corridors attest. In the school’s
t h e a t r e, all are clustered around tables
dressed in sandals and togas.Some of the
boys are resplendent in Romano-Greek
helmets and body armour. The teachers
too are dressed in togas and despite the
usual flights of balls of paper from one
table to the other and an occasional
s n i g g e r, the atmosphere is positively
b u s i n e s s l i k e.
Working math, science and computing
into a topic that encompasses role playing
from the cave-dwellers onwards may sound
faintly ridiculous to some, but Tu b e l s k y
quietly assures that his approach results in
between 60 and 70 percent of school leavers
going on to higher education and all
becoming self-reliant, responsible and
balanced adults.“I cannot describe a typical
g r a d u a t e : the whole idea of the school is not
to categorize people, but the main feature
I observe is that if they fail in something,
they never blame someone else.They refle c t
on the reasons for their failure and try to
use that experience to move on.”
Yulia To u r c h a n i n o v a , a professor of
education and former head of the Russian
in-service teacher training organization, a
close associate of Tu b e l s k y,puts it like this:
“It is freedom that generates and brings
up responsibility.
Slaves are the most
irresponsible people:
i t ’s not their work, n o t
their results and they
d o n ’t care. Only a free
person is a
responsible person.”
I t ’s this inner
freedom that the
school aims to foster
in students and is one
of the reasons it
attracts a steady
stream of visitors.
Vehemently opposed
to the international conventional wisdom
of standards, testing, ranking tables and
academic streaming, the school does not
work with specially selected pupils: 8 0
percent are drawn from the local district,
a suburban area characterized by high
unemployment, poverty and criminality.
The rest are accepted from families
throughout the city anxious to take
advantage of the rare opportunities for
self-development offered.
Finances and behavioural problems
common to all Russian schools are no
s t r a n g e r s. The school’s monthly budget of
$15,000 may be ten times as much as
R t i s h c h e v o ’s School No. 2 , but is still low by
western European standards. D o n a t i o n s
from parents and sponsors totalled $9,000
during 2000. Most teachers earn around
1,800 roubles ($64) and many moonlight
as private tutors.Disciplinary problems are
resolved through a school court,
emphasizing the philosophy that all
individuals must be held accountable for
their actions.
I t ’s a tough act for any school principal
to maintain, more so in Russia where
examples of corruption and lack of
responsibility abound.A casual comment
by some students when challenged by a
group of visiting teachers from Vo l g o g r a d
over their “ u n w o r k m a n l i k e ”dress  sums up
its success. “ Why should we dress
d i f f e r e n t l y ? ” they asked. “ We don’t work
h e r e ; we live here.” ■
