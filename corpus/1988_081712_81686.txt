A refined value oí pi
The irrational numberpz can be computed to an infinite number of decimal
places. It expresses the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter,
a relationship which cannot be framed in terms of whole numbers. (Pi is
needed to compute the area of a circle or volume of a sphere.) The value of
pi was computed by Archimedes to three decimal places, and by Ptolemy
to four decimal places. But after that, for 1,450 years, no greater accuracy
was achieved in the Western world. The Chinese, however, made great
strides forward in computing pi.
One way in which the ancient mathematicians tried to approach an
accurate value forpi was to inscribe polygons with more and more sides to
them inside circles, so that the areas of the polygons (which could be
computed) would more and more closely approach the area of the circle.
Thus, they could try to find a value iorpi, since the circle's area was found
by using the formula containing it. (They could measure the diameter, and
squeeze a polygon whose area they knew into the circle; the only unknown
number would be pi, which could then be calculated.) Archimedes used a
96-sided polygon, and decided thatpi had a value between 3.142 and 3.140.
The Chinese tried to sneak up on pi in the same fashion. Liu Hui in the
third century AD started by inscribing a polygon of 192 sides in a circle,
and then went on to inscribe one of 3,072 sides which "squeezed" even
closer. He was thus able to calculate a value oípi oí 3.14159. At this point,
the Chinese overtook the Greeks.
But the real leap forward came in the fifth century AD, when truly
advanced values for pi appeared in China. The mathematicians Zu
Chongzhi and Zu Gengzhi (father and son), by means of calculations
which have been lost, obtained an "accurate" value of pi to ten decimal
places, as 3.1415929203. The circle used for the inscribing of the polygons
is known to have been 10 feet across. This value for pi was recorded in
historical records of the period, but the actual books of those mathemati¬
cians have vanished over the centuries. Nine hundred years later, the
mathematician Zao Yugin (about 1300 AD) set himself to verify this value
of pi. He inscribed polygons in a circle with the enormous number of
16,384 sides. He thus confirmed the value given by the Zu family.
