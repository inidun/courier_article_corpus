In the search for new sources of capital,
labour and raw mat e rials are multina-
tional corp o r ations looking to relocate in
“pollution have n s ”where environmental regu-
l ations are lax if not non-existent?
The question is increasingly being asked
at a time when the level of foreign direct
i nvestment (FDI) is rising sharp l y. This is

mainly due to the fact that both “ s o u r c e ”a n d

something to gain from the FDI process.

the benefits of new FDI by lowe ring their
environmental standards or by reducing
e f f o rts to enforce existing standards,and that
firms will relocate to these “pollution
h ave n s ” , to gain a cost advantage over their
competitors. In this scenario, developing
c o u n t ries are regarded as the most likely sites
of pollution havens because they may be the
c o u n t ries most willing to trade off their env i-
ronmental quality for economic gains, a n d
i n d u s t rialized countries are cast in the role
of predat o rs willing to degrade the env i r o n-
ment of developing countries in order to
generate economic gains for themselves.
H owe ve r , most research suggests that , ove-
rall, companies do not invest overseas to
obtain access to lower environmental costs.
It is difficult to determine whether FDI
flows are affected by the level of environ-
mental regulations existing in foreign coun-
t ri e s. Foreign capital clearly flows to a wide
range of countries, industries and compa-
nies—some of which are careful env i r o n-
mental stewards;some of which are not.A
firm may in any case invest in a country to
take advantage of a high quality labour
force and other factors unrelated to envi-
ronmental costs.
Respect for the environment:
a good selling point
Environmental costs are often a relati-
vely small component of total production
costs,which may sometimes even be lower
when environmental standards are higher
(for example, where lower env i r o n m e n t a l
standards lead to higher costs of treat i n g
industrial water supplies).
M u l t i n ationals often seem more inter-
ested in consistent enforcement of env i r o n-
mental rules than in lower standards per se.
M o r e ove r , companies are often willing to
make new investments that actually improve

the env i r o n m e n t , so long as their main com-
p e t i t o rs are also required to do so. Pa rt of
the reason for this is that multinationals fre-
quently apply a single environmental stan-
dard to their world-wide operat i o n s ,r e g a r d-
less of any (lower) standards which may exist
in a particular country.There could be three
main reasons for this.
F i rs t , the firm may have calculated that
it cannot afford to see the reputation of its
products in the (global) market-place tar-
nished by charges of “ e nv i r o n m e n t a l
e x p l o i t at i o n ” in one particular locat i o n —
charges which can sometimes result in boy-
cotts or other forms of consumer pressure.
For example, i nve s t o rs in Puerto Rican
banana production firms have insisted on
“due environmental care” by those firms,
because they perceive that ove rseas mar-
kets for their products will demand higher
levels of environmental quality.

S e c o n d , the firm may have calculat e d
t h at it is less expensive to apply a single
e nvironmental standard to its (globally-
i n t e gr ated) production processes, r at h e r
than to develop “tailor-made” production
l i n e s , based on va rying levels of env i r o n-
mental standards.
F i n a l l y, the ability of firms to make
“ d i rt y ” i nvestments may be limited by
requirements in their home country. Fo r
example,the US Ex-Im Bank requires any
US company taking advantage of its export
financing assistance to meet certain mini-
mum environmental criteria.
On the other hand, there is some evi-
dence to suggest that “pollution have n s ”d o
exist within certain types of firm s ,o p e r at i n g
in specific industri e s , and in particular coun-
t ri e s. I nvestments made in the resource
extraction and processing sectors , such as
c h e m i c a l s ,m e t a l l u r g y, l o g gi n g,and pulp and
p a p e r , fall into this cat e g o ry. In these indus-
t ri e s , pollution control costs can make up a
s i g n i ficant proportion of the firm ’s total
c o s t s.The result can be that small cost diffe-
rences can translate into large changes in
market share and profit a b i l i t y.These firm s
are more susceptible to the level of env i r o n-
mental costs, and therefore more likely to
i nvest in “pollution have n s ” .H owe ve r , t h i s
does not necessarily mean that countri e s
actually lower their environmental standards
to attract new inve s t m e n t s.
There is clearly competition, b o t h
within and between countri e s , to obtain
access to new FDI. It is particularly keen in
the rapidly-industrializing countri e s , a n d
An ethic of eco-efficiency, which seeks to ‘design out’
pollution problems rather than deal with unwanted waste,
is increasingly accepted
in countries which are dependent on the
resource extraction and processing indus-
t ries in which the potential for hard cur-
r e n cy export earnings may be ve ry high. I n
these situat i o n s , incoming inve s t o rs can
often successfully argue for relief from
“high”environmental costs.
But surp rising though it may seem,
i nve s t o rs in resource-based industries do
not always exert pressures for lower envi-
ronmental standards—sometimes they may
even want standards in the host country to
be raised.
C o m p e t i t i ve pressures can also translat e
into a desire to reduce waste and improve
p r o d u c t i v i t y, which can lead to improve d
e nvironmental perform a n c e .An ethic of eco-
e f f i c i e n cy, which seeks to “design out”p o l l u-
tion problems rather than deal with unwa n-
ted wa s t e , is increasingly accepted.
FDI is also often associated with
m o d e rn technologies which represent env i-
ronmental improvements over what is cur-
rently available in the host country. Once
the investment has been made, local firms
m ay try to imitate multinat i o n a l s ’e nv i r o n-
mental practices. But there is also evidence
t h at certain kinds of enterp rises (e.g. t h e
t own and village enterp rises of rural China)
seem prone to use outdated technical
equipment from other countries that does
not represent the “best environmental tech-
n o l o g y ” , because they are undercapitalized
and because this equipment is cheap.
There is also some evidence that “pol-
lution have n s ” m ay be associated with
something other than the level of environ-
mental standards. For example, pollution
intensities did appear to increase more
rapidly in Latin A m e rica as a whole bet-
ween 1970 and 1990, after environmental
r e g u l ations in OECD countries became
stricter. But it was not the countries with
the lowest environmental standards which
attracted the most pollution-intensive
investment—it was those countries which
were less open to FDI in the first place.
“ Pollution have n s ” were found, but they
seemed to be more closely associated with
protectionist economies than with lowe r
environmental standards.
O ve r a l l ,c o u n t ries which operate straight-
f o r wa r d , t r a n s p a r e n t , and efficient env i r o n-
mental programmes seem to experience no
p a rticular loss of FDI flow s , and may in fa c t
attract some industries which are looking for
reliable ove rseas bases of operat i o n . In short ,
g ove rnments are recognizing that lowe ri n g
e nvironmental standards to attract new FDI
is often unnecessary. ■
