Driven by strong political will and local involvement, Uganda has embarked on an
ambitious pro g ramme to get all children into school by 2003
When a country decides that education is
going to become a top pri o ri t y, then moun-
tains can be moved in a very short time.
Uganda is a case in point. Since President Yoweri
Museveni fulfilled his campaign pledge to provide
free education for up to four children per family in
1 9 9 6 , enrolment figures have soared from 2.3 to 6.5
million primary-aged children.
As Museveni has often said,“If we are to indus-
t ri a l i z e , we need an educated populat i o n .”The will
to promote such a policy is rooted in Uganda’s
emergence from ye a rs of conflict during the seve n-
ties and eighties. Between 1971 and 1985, gross
domestic product (GDP) declined, and educat i o n ’s
share of it fell from 3.4 to 1.4 per cent—about four
times below the A f rican ave r a g e .When the Nat i o n a l
Resistance Movement (NRM) assumed power in
1986,the education system had collapsed and the
c o u n t ry had become one of the poorest in the
wo r l d .The gove rnment immediately commissioned
an in-depth analysis of the education sector, c o n s u l-
ting widely with all stakeholders around the country.
This process fostered a broad-based sense of ow n e r-
ship of the ensuing national education policy and
paved the way for the declaration of the Universal
Primary Education programme (UPE), officially
launched in December 1996.The time frame for
completion is 2003.
G r a n t e d , the country now boasts one of A f ri c a ’s
best performing economies, with real GDP gr o-
wing at an average of 6.5 per cent since 1987. It wa s
the first to be declared eligible and to benefit from
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative in
April 1998, with a fraction of debt relief allocated
to educat i o n .O verall expenditure on pri m a ry edu-
c ation increased 40 per cent for the first year of UPE
and another 28 per cent the subsequent year. Pri-
m a ry education now accounts for 64 per cent of the
total education budget,up from 30 per cent at the
b e ginning of the 1990s, and the programme is also 
benefiting from strong donor support.At constant
p ri c e s , Uganda spent only US$8 annually per pupil
in the early 1980s, compared to $32.50 in the fin a n-
cial year 1997/98.
“When the policy was announced, there wa s
quite a bit of confusion at the community level,”
recalls UNICEF’s Charles Nadongo. “It wa s
thought that the central gove rnment was supposed
to take care of eve ry t h i n g .N ow the policy has been
c l a ri fied to ensure that all part n e rs understand their
roles.”The policy coincided with the decentraliza-
tion of several public serv i c e s , notably putting
schools under the management of the country ’s
39 distri c t s. S e n s i t i z ation and training seminars
were held for local political and religious leaders ,a s
well as administrative personnel, while radio pro-
grammes also gr e atly helped in clarifying roles.
“Because of the decentralized nature of powe r ,l e a-
ders are accountable at the local level and have a
strong obligation to make sure it works.”
The progr a m m e ’s hallmark lies in suddenly
making education affordable for thousands of fa m i-
lies. Before the introduction of UPE,parents bore
the cost of school fees, were expected to provide uni-
f o rm s ,e xercise books, textbooks and in some cases
money for a building fund used by authorities for
expanding school blocks or renovating existing
o n e s. Fees alone could range from 35,000 to 45,000
Ugandan shillings ($23-$30) per school term . In a
survey conducted in January 1997, 80 per cent of
parents interviewed stated that lack of money had
p r e vented them from sending their children to
s c h o o l . Under the current progr a m m e , school fees
are wa i ved and textbooks are free, but the rest of the
deal is a cost-sharing one.
G ove rnment provides iron sheets, c e m e n t ,
timber and nails for building classrooms, with local
a u t h o rities and communities expected to supply
additional inputs. Parents must provide uniforms,
pens and exercise books as well as help in managi n g

g ove rnment are properly used,” s ays A h m e d
S e k a n d i , who is helping to reconstruct a school
destroyed by war. In some cases,local councils are
imposing an education tax to raise revenue for
school deve l o p m e n t . School management com-
mittees have been strengthened and expanded to
include teachers , parents and community repre-
s e n t at i ves and are much more active than in the past
according to Mary Kasozi, aWorld Bank officer.
Part of the programme’s success is owed to a
“new part n e rship between the gove rnment and the
NGO sector,” according to Albert Byamugisha of
the Ministry of Education and Sport s. In some
c a s e s , old alliances have been revitalized, e s p e c i a l l y
with the churches, which were once the backbone
of the education system. Church organizations have
p r ovided input into the new syllabu s.According to
the NGO World Vision, which is involved in edu-
c ation projects in 17 Ugandan distri c t s , “The rela-
tionship between gove rnment and NGOs has gr e at l y
i m p r oved because the gove rnment officials now
view the latter as a great asset.”
In many cases, the funds previously used by
NGOs to support tuition fees have now been
released and earmarked for classroom constru c-
t i o n , teacher training and help in providing lunches
and uniforms.Technical co-operation with foreign
donors has also been bolstered.
Although it is too early to assess their impact,
i nvestments are also being made in quality. S o m e
20,000 teachers have been hired, training has been
b o o s t e d , notably through community-based pro-
gr a m m e s , and salaries have significantly increased,
although most say that the current wage (U. S h s.
72,000/US$48 per month) is too low to make ends
m e e t .A new syllabus is being developed which places
gr e ater emphasis on practical subjects such as agri-
c u l t u r e , home economics, animal husbandry and
e nvironmental studies.
But considerable hurdles remain.There are not
enough schools.The official pupil-teacher ratio is 63
(up from 37 in 1996), but it is not rare for pri m a ry
school teachers to have to cope with classes of 150
p u p i l s. According to World V i s i o n , there is bittern e s s
in urban areas because of ove r c r ow d i n g, and many
families have started opting for pri vate schools.T h e
c u rrent strat e gic education investment plan (1998-
2003) calls for the building of some 25,000 class-
rooms and the renovation of dilapidated bu i l d i n g s
along with the establishment of community poly-
technics to provide multi-skill training for pri m a ry -
school leave rs. G i ven present enrolment trends, i t
can be foreseen that students will run up against a shor-
tage of secondary schools in a few ye a rs time.And eve n
though the programme has opened up the school to
new leagues of children, UNICEF expresses concern
t h at this is not enough.
G i r l s ’ enrolment is only slowly inching up (47
per cent in 1999).“ We estimate that there are about
15 per cent of children who are not making it to
s c h o o l .The curriculum and learning experiences have
to be better adapted to vulnerable gr o u p s ;o t h e r w i s e
the push-out effects will be gr e at ,” s ays Nadongo.
E f f o rts are underway to better cater to the most mar-
ginalized gr o u p s , in particular nomadic communities
in the nort h e a s t e rn Karamoja regi o n ,where the UPE
p r o gramme has had a minimal impact.H e r e , in part-
n e rship with gove rn m e n t ,NGOs and UN agencies are
spearheading projects to make school fit in with the
l i ves of children, and not the other way around. ð■
