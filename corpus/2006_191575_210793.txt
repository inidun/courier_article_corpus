rwanda  
when women set the example
DFor more than 10 years, Espérance 
Murorunkwere has been a shop-
keeper in Kigali, the Rwandan capi-
tal. This forty-year-old mother of four 
sells cleaning products imported 
from Kenya. Her stall is located in the 
Matheus neighborhood, a regional 
hub for imported goods. Espérance 
is amongst the women who have 
succeeded in Rwanda, twelve years 
after the genocide which took near-
ly 800,000 victims, or 10% of the 
country’s population, from the Great 
Lakes region. 
Her case is far from isolated. Even 
if the majority of the Rwandan popu-
lation has not taken the step, a true 
revolution has taken place in the 
country over the last ten years. The 
civil war that rocked the country in 
1994, marked a social turning point, 
supported by a demographic reality: 
following the genocide, 70% of the 
population was made up of women. 
United within associations, these 
women took in children that were 
orphaned by the conflict, rallied in 
numbers to defend human rights, 
made headway against illiteracy 
and promoted microcredit.
But women are also present in 
more unexpected fields. It is not un-
heard of to see a woman on a con-
struction site, at a bank counter or 
at the wheel of a taxi. They’ve come 
a long way when we know that not 
so long ago, the legislative system 
was largely discriminatory.

For example: a woman could not 
inherit goods from her parents nor 
her husband, while the contrary 
was possible. 
It has to be said that women paid 
a high price during the genocide. 
According to estimates, between 
250,000 to 500,000 were victims 
of sexual violence (Source: United 
Nations). Studies conducted on 
women who had been raped during 
the genocide revealed that two thirds 
had been infected with HIV and 
AIDS or other sexually transmitted

diseases and 80% were “seriously 
traumatized”. Moreover, it is estimated 
that 50% lost their husbands during 
the conflict. Numerous other women, 
whose husbands found refuge in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo in 
1994, found themselves heads of 
family from one day to the next.
Rwanda, model of 
equality
Stuck hard by the genocide, women 
have not only played an integral 
role in the physical reconstruction, 
but also in the painful national rec-
onciliation process. It is true that 
far fewer women were implicated 
directly in the massacres: they rep-
resent 5% of people imprisoned 
after the genocide. 
These changes have been also 
translated into the country’s institu-
tions. The new constitution adopted 
in 2003 foresees that 30% of ad-
ministrative positions or those with-
in government bodies, are reserved 
for women. Following the October 
2004 elections, women occupied 
48.8% of seats in the Chamber of 
Deputies. In comparison, women 
occupied 45% of seats within the 
Swedish national parliament, long 
time considered a model for wom-
en’s equality. 
“This change is significant, but the 
path remains long to attain equal-
ity between the two sexes at all 
levels of political and economic 
decision-making,” says Espérance 
Murorunkwere. Meanwhile, Déogra-
tias Kayumba, Vice-President of 
the National Consultative Commis-
sion of Human Rights (NCCHR) 
hails the important breakthrough in 
this area. But he also laments that 
many Rwandans remain at the bot-
tom of the social ladder. In other 
areas, battles such as the decrimi-
nalization of abortion still remain to 
be fought. 
It should be noted that in the long 
run, the disappearance of numer-
ous women infected by HIV and 
AIDS compromises the work of 
emancipation undertaken by the 
survivors of genocide.
