OISE has always been
with us, but never has it been so
obvious, so intense, so varied and so
pervasive as it is today.
Modern life has been made easier
by numerous technological innova¬
tions, but some of the side-effects
make progress as a whole seem prob¬
lematical and indeed, in some res¬
pects more like regression. In addition
to the serious problems of air pollution
and water pollution we now have to
contend with "noise pollution" in many
forms.
Unlike the lucky few who can spend
their lives far from the clamour of
our technological age, most people, at
least in industrial areas, are obliged
to live and work under conditions in
which noise often attains an alarming
level. In the home, children are unable
to sleep or are suddenly aroused by
the roar of a passing aircraft or the
din of a noisily revving automobile.
Older people also suffer from these
disturbances. Deprived of a proper
night's sleep in a well-ventilated room,
many people are unable to recuperate
the physical and mental energy they
have used up at work and will need
again next day. They try to shut out

noise by keeping windows closed or
wearing ear plugs. And even then they
cannot be sure of sleeping undis¬
turbed.
Next morning they have to face
another day of hard work, often in
noisy surroundings, which means that
more nervous energy is burned up in
resisting the stress of no se, instead
of being used productively.
Insufficient rest and relaxation inevi¬
tably reduce efficiency. Noise, in fact,
causes an incalculable loss of nervous
energy to the detriment of the health
and well-being of the individual and
ultimately to the detriment of the
national economy as a whole.
Although these facts have been
confirmed by studies and research in
Switzerland and many other countries,
a few people still maintain that until
noise "has turned a grey mouse into
a white one", all that has been affirm¬
ed about the effects of noise is merely
theoretical and therefore inconclusive.
Such persons are merely side-track¬
ing the problem. It is just as though
the painstaking research on noise that
has been going on over the past ten
years, leading in each case to iden¬
tical conclusions, has been a complete
waste of time.
Yet anyone who observes present-
day conditions of life not only in our
cities, but increasingly in the country¬
side too, can see for himself the direct
and indirect effects of incessant noise
on modern man: nervous troubles,
reduced powers of concentration, in¬
efficient work, increasing absenteeism,
among others.
These few examples give us a
general idea of the present state of
affairs. How did we come to be in
such a situation? Primarily because
social and legal measures were not
taken to prevent it, and for the failure
to act in time the public authorities
bear the major responsibility. For far
too long the spread of noise was
accepted as a natural process, as a
price to be paid for our technological
progress. Law, justice and public
authorities all capitulated to techno¬
logy.
In such a situation the average per¬
son tended to feel, and to become,
helpless. The first wave of protests
gave way to resignation. People
shrugged their shoulders and said
"There's nothing we can do about it".
But just over ten years ago orga¬
nizations were set up in a number of
European countries to wage campaigns
against the spread of noise. These
bodies, whose organizers were often
eminent doctors, jurists, engineers and
specialists in acoustics, decided to
unite their action and in 1959 formed
the International Association Against
Noise. The Association has so far
held four important congresses on
noise abatement (Zurich, 1960; Salz¬
burg, 1962; Paris, 1964; Baden-Baden,

in London early next year.
It is all very well to set up orga¬
nizations and hold congresses and
meetings in different countries but
what practical results have been
achieved by all this? Here are a few
examples:
By stimulating new activities, meet¬
ings and congresses have given an
impetus to basic research and have
promoted progress, often of outstand¬
ing value. But it obviously takes more
than a few years to eliminate even
the major part of all the noise
that has been accumulated by the
unbridled expansion of technology
over several decades. Achievements
during the past ten years in acoustics,
sound-proofing techniques and the
introduction of anti-noise regulations
have nevertheless been remarkable.
Each of the congresses of
the International Association Against
Noise has enabled over 500 specialists
to exchange ideas, pool their expe¬
rience and establish fruitful contacts
on both the personal and scientific
levels.
Since its foundation and especially
on the occasion of its four congresses
the Association has established con¬
tacts with major international organiza¬
tions, including the United Nations
Office in Geneva, the World Health
Organization, the Council of Europe,
the European Conference of Ministers
of Transport and the International
Organizations for Standardization. It
also works closely with other organi¬
zations concerned with anti-noise cam-

On a scale graduated in decibels, this
"noise barometer" in a street in Zurich
(Switzerland) shows passers-by how much
noise nearby traffic is making. The decibel
is a unit used to measure different inten¬
sities of sound and is calculated from the
level at which sound becomes audible to
the human ear. But neither the subjective
impression of noise perceived by the ear
nor the degree of disturbance it causes
can be measured with precision on the
decibel scale. The 50-decibel change of
intensity between the noise of people
conversing and the rustling of leaves (see
scale, left) is far less noticeable than the
50-decibel gap between the same conversa¬
tion and the noise of a jet engine. High
frequency (high-pitched) sounds grate on
the ear more than those with a low pitch.
paigns, and its specialists are fre¬
quently consulted on major problems
and decisions in the field of noise
abatement.
Since its directorate has always
comprised a physician, an engineer, a
specialist in acoustics and two jurists,
the International Association is in a
position to give prompt and authori¬
tative opinions on questions of inter¬
national scope within its field.
If the problem of noise is to be
resolved several factors will have to
be kept constantly in mind:
Although the campaign against
noise is a global problem, its starting
point must be the individual. An
individual effort to overcome egotism
is a prerequisite of any collective anti-
noise campaign. Anyone unable to
make this effort of self-restraint and
incapable of recognizing the real
meaning of technical creativity, is
already a victim of the technological
era along with its unwanted products:
noise and the pollution of air and
water.
Noise and reflection are mutually
exclusive. Noise is an obstacle to
brainwork and can easily disrupt a
vital train of thought.
It would be wrong to blame techno¬
logy for all the noise, past and
present, that has afflicted man. Tech¬
nology as such is neither good nor
bad. It is the men behind it who
are responsible for noise, and it is
for them to seek the remedies. As
Professor Günther Lehmann, President
of the International Association Against
Noise has said, "Noise is not a mea¬
sure of the progress of technology,
but a sign of regression".
When it comes to doing something
practical about excessive noise, it is
clear that most people are unwilling
to take the initiative. Noise can be
tackled with some hope of success
only with the backing of public opinion
and proper laws and regulations.
Law-making is therefore a vital factor
in anti-noise campaigns.
But laws are effective only when
they are rigorously enforced. And
public interest in anti-noise campaigns
usually needs arousing, since many
people, even the well-educated, fail to
realize the harm that permanent and
excessive noise can do to the human
organism.
To stimulate this interest, effective
public information campaigns are
needed, based on the authoritative
scientific data collected in the past
ten years by national and international
bodies, whose members include many
distinguished specialists.

Sound echos down a narrow
street as youngsters speed along
on motorized bicycles. A sign of
youthful high spirits, perhaps, but
disturbing for the neighbourhood.
According to some studies,
one reason why teen-agers enjoy
making so much noise with
motorscooters and similar
vehicles is that it gives them
a feeling of power.
One example is the report submitted
to the Swiss Government in 1963 by
specialists in the Swiss Federal Anti-
Noise Commission. Its conclusions,
by the way, agree with those present¬
ed to the U.K. Parliamant the same
year by the British Committee on the
Problem of Noise.
The Swiss Anti-Noise Commission is
composed of 52 specialists and its
studies and research are carried out
by five sub-commissions dealing with
basic medical, acoustic and technical
questions; road, rail, sea and river
traffic; aircraft noise; noise in industry,
building construction, homes etc; and
legal questions.
Their work has enabled encouraging
progress to be made in Switzerland.
Public indifference to the increase of
noise is gradually disappearing. More
vigorous legal and administrative ac¬
tion is being taken against persons
failing to comply with noise regula¬
tions. An official research, testing and
advisory centre (the Acoustics and
Anti-Noise Division of the Federal
Materials Testing Institute, af Düben¬
dorf, near Zurich) has been set up.
The "maximum noise level" scales
established by the Swiss Anti-Noise
Commission have also been of great
value (see below)-
Figures are given in decibels (dB,
the measurement unit for noise). A
level of 80-85 dB is what is normally
expected from the continuous noise in
a busy main street of a large city.
These maximum noise levels have
been accepted by the Swiss courts.

Like those already in force for auto¬
mobiles in many countries, the Swiss
maximum noise levels are easier to
enforce nowadays thanks to technical
advances in noise prevention during
the past ten years.
In building construction, for example,
relatively silent machines have taken
over the job of foundation digging
from the far noiser pile-divers, electro¬
mechanical drills replace the clattering
compressed-air variety and special
screens now absorb the din of com¬
pressors.
Automobile noises can be reduced
by the more effective exhaust mufflers
now available and also by non-slam
doors and boot lids.
Much can be done to reduce the din
of aircraft. Already some have been
fitted with silencers and further im¬
provement has come from the installa¬
tion at airports of acoustic check posts
and sound-proofed hangars for testing

engines. The enforcement of stricter
flying regulations has also played its
part.
Sound absorbing materials, drapes,
curtains and carpets which deaden
noise, quieter air-conditioners, venti¬
lators and other household appliances,
and sound-insulated ceilings, walls,
doors and windows all help to make
the home a quieter and more restful
place.
Combating noise is above all a
question of showing consideration for
others and of the right kind of
upbringing. It thus has to begin in
the home as part of the education of
children and adolescents.
To sum up, it seems certain that our
present understanding of the problem
of noise coupled with our technical
knowledge and resources now give
us the means to bar the way to distur¬
bances from noise. But those who
undertake this task will need great
courage and determination, since many
people still fail to recognize the real
importance of anti-noise campaigns,
especially those who rate technical
progress higher than ethical values.
A current example of this attitude
is the effort now being made by the
aeronautical industry to pursuade us
that we shall enjoy the din of
supersonic airliners. Public relations
machinery and techniques are working
on an unsuspecting public with the
slogan "learn to live with the boom".
But booms and bangs are incompatible
with daily life. Anyone who cannot
see this is gambling with nature,
instead of living in harmony with it.
