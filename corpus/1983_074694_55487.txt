Memories come rushing back to me
pell-mell, memories that for twenty
years have played upon my feelings and
my inner consciousness. From the time
that I became aware of the outer world
I was steeped in a linguistic environ¬
ment which was preponderantly
English and bilingual, French being
reserved for use in the home. The end
result of this overlapping of two
languages, or, to be more precise, of
one language over another, was to pro¬
duce an undifferentiated web in which
words went in two's, pairings which
came through to me as a single signal.
Door/porte, pull/tirer, pont/bridge,
meat/viande, lundi/Monday, péage/
toll, men/hommes, address/adresse,
merci/thank you, bienvenue/welcome.
Posters, advertisements, signs were all
around me. This, I thought, is how the
world is.
This was also how it was in Montreal
when I arrived there in 1947, and, in¬
deed, how it was throughout the Pro¬
vince. In the street (the Rue Principale,
the Rue Saint-Vincent, the Rue Tour-
du-Lac) I used to hear English spoken
more often than not and see French
Canadians the shopkeepers, the
workmen all deferentially getting by
as best they could in this language.
Some of them were proud to do this;
others, I felt, were less so. Already I
could hear all around me what I had
heard over twenty years wherever I had
lived or travelled: "So-and-so gets by
very well in English' ' ; " Look at old So-

and-so, he's got a good job, he speaks
English"; "He's educated, he knows
English", or its variant, "He's a
cultivate(i man, he speaks English";
"He's completely bilingual", and so
on.
Later, in Montreal, I was on several
occasions to hear something which
went much further: "1 speak English so
well that when I am with the English
(English-speaking Canadians) they
can't tell that I am French Canadian",
or words to that effect. When, at the
age of twenty-five, I began to ponder
the significance of these remarks, I
found it abnormal that the notion of
being educated or cultured should be
My father, on the other hand, was a
man of principle and was insistent that
we should give up neither our language
nor our faith. But he was a victim of
circumstance and his own situation. He
was a carpentry contractor and a high
percentage of his customers were
English. Yet he spoke English only with
great difficulty. One day I was present
during a particularly halting discussion
with a rich customer. After she had
left, he said to me: "You, at any rate,
are going to learn English." At eight
years old, that had a powerful effect on
me.
My father often took me with him to
his work-sites and on visits to the

assimilated to the fact of knowing
someone else's language. But to pass
oneself off as someone else, to be
ashamed of oneself, seemed to me to be
the dregs of the dregs.
Amongst my relatives, more than in
my immediate family, English was

the end of the world. Everywhere we
went, whenever the question of work or
of the children's future came up, we
were urged to learn English; and those
for whom it was too late expressed their
regrets at not having learnt it as though
to encourage us to do so. No doubt
about it, this language was the first
one.
