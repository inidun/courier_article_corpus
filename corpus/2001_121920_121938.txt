The anti-nuclear movement has spawned many environmental organizations. The hazards of
radioactive waste, passed down to future generations, and the risks of proliferation or accidents,
fuel our opposition. The greenhouse effect does not after our position. Solving the problem of
climate change with nuclear energy is like replacing the plague with cholera.
In the framework of the Kyoto protocol, the discussions do not focus on nuclear power as such,
but on how appropriate it is to include it in the flexibility mechanisms intended for Eastern Europe
or the developing countries. Is a wealthy country that invests in nuclear energy in another nation
entitled to CO2 “credits”that could count towards its reduction objectives or be sold on the open
market? Our answer is no, because nuclear power is not a sustainable energy source and therefore
cannot be encouraged by the Kyoto protocol. Countries that have agreed to cut CO2 emissions
plan to combine “internal” efforts [in their own countries] with external ones [in developing
countries or eastern Europe]. They could store up CO2 credits by building a few reactors in the
poorest countries, to the detriment of renewable energy sources, which are harder to put in place.
In Eastern Europe, all they would have to do in order to acquire CO2 credits is patch up an already-
operating nuclear power plant and keep it functioning for ten years.We believe that nuclear power
has received enough subsidies over the past 40 years. Now a chance must be given to other
energy sources, such as wind and solar power. Flexibility mechanisms must encourage the growth
of energy sources that everyone considers sustainable. ■
