ALL my life I have wondered
about the possibility of life
elsewhere. What would it be
like? Of what would it be made? All
living things on our planet are
constructed of organic molecules
complex microscopic architectures in
which the carbon atom plays a central
role. There was once a time before life,
when the earth was barren and utterly
desolate. Our world is now overflowing
with life. How did it come about?.
How, in the absence of life, were
. carbon-based organic molecules made?
How did the first living things arise?
How did life evolve to produce beings
as elaborate and complex as we, able to
explore the mystery of our own
origins?
And on the countless other planets
that may circle other suns, is there life
also? Is extraterrestrial life, if it exists,
based on the same organic molecules as
life on Earth? Do the beings of other
worlds look much like life on Earth? Or
are they stunningly different other
adaptations to other environments?
In the great dark between the stars
there are clouds of gas and dust and
organic matter. Dozens of different
kinds of organic molecules have been
found out there by radio telescopes.
The abundance of these molecules sug¬
gests that the stuff of life is everywhere.
CARL SAGAN, of the USA, is director of the
Laboratory for Planetary Studies and David
Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space
Sciences at Cornell University, Ithaca, New
York. A former chairman of the Division for
Planetary Sciences of the American
Astronomical Society, he played a leading role
in the Mariner, Viking and Voyager expedi¬
tions to the planets. He is the author, co¬
author or editor of more than a dozen books in¬
cluding Intelligent Life in the Universe, The
Cosmic Connection, The Dragons of Eden,
and Broca's Brain, and in 1978 he was award¬
ed the Pulitzer Prize for literature. This article
is extracted from Cosmos, a book based on
Professor Sagan's major television series
which has attracted a worldwide viewing
audience of millions throughout the world.
Perhaps the origin and evolution of life
is, given enough time, a cosmic in¬
evitability. On some of the thousands
of millions of planets in the Milky Way
Galaxy, life may never arise. On others
it may arise and die out, or never evolve
beyond its simplest forms. And on
some small fraction of worlds there
may develop intelligences and civiliza¬
tions more advanced than our own.
Occasionally someone remarks on
what a lucky coincidence it is that the
Earth is perfectly suitable for life
moderate temperatures, liquid, water,
oxygen atmosphere, and so on. But this
is, at least in part, a confusion of cause
and effect. We earthlings are supreme¬
ly well adapted to the environment of
the Earth because we grew up here.
Those earlier forms of life that were not
well adapted died. We are descended
from the organisms that did well.
Organisms that evolve on a quite dif¬
ferent world will doubtless sing its
praises too.
All life on Earth is closely related.
We have a common organic chemistry
and a common evolutionary heritage.
As a result, our biologists are pro¬
foundly limited. They study only a
single kind of biology, one lonely
theme in the music of life. Is this faint
and reedy tune the only voice for
thousands of light-years? Or is there a
kind of cosmic fugue, with themes and
counterpoints, dissonances and har¬
monies, a thousand million different
voices playing the life music of the
Galaxy?
What happened here on Earth may
be more or less typical of the evolution
of life on many worlds; but in such
details as the chemistry of proteins or
the neurology of brains, the story of
life on Earth may be unique in all the
Milky Way Galaxy.
The Earth condensed out of in¬
terstellar gas and dust some 4.6 thou-
31

sand million years ago. We know from
the fossil record that the origin of life
happened soon after, perhaps around
four thousand million years ago, in the
ponds and oceans of the primitive
Earth.
The first living things were not
anything so complicated as a one-celled
organism, already a highly
sophisticated form of life. The first
stirrings were much more humble. In
those early days, lightning and ultra¬
violet light from the Sun were breaking
apart the simple hydrogen-rich
molecules of the primitive atmosphere,
the fragments spontaneously recom-
bining into more and more complex
molecules. The products of this early
chemistry were dissolved in the oceans,
forming a kind of organic soup of
gradually increasing complexity, until
one day, quite by accident, a molecule
arose that was able to make crude
copies of itself, using as building blocks
other molecules in the soup.
This was the earliest ancestor of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the
master molecule of life on Earth. It is
shaped like a ladder twisted into a
helix, the rungs available in four dif¬
ferent molecular parts, which con¬
stitute the four letters of the genetic
code. These rungs, called nucleotides,
spell out the hereditary instructions for
making a given organism.
Every lifeform on Earth has a dif¬
ferent set of instructions, written out in
essentially the same language. The
reason organisms are different is the
differences in their nucleic instructions.
A mutation is a change in a nucleotide,
copied in the next generation, which
breeds true. Since mutations are ran¬
dom nucleotide changes, most of them
are harmful or lethal, coding into ex¬
istence non-functional enzymes. It is a
long wait before a mutation makes an
organism work better. And yet it is that
improbable event, a small beneficial
mutation in a nucleotide a ten-
millionth of a centimetre across, that
makes evolution work.
Four thousand million years ago, the
Earth was a molecular Garden of Eden.
There were as yet no predators. Some
molecules reproduced themselves in¬
efficiently, competing for building
blocks, and left crude copies of
themselves. With reproduction, muta¬
tion and the selective elimination of the
least efficient varieties, evolution was
well under way, even at the molecular
level.
As time went on they got better at
reproducing. Molecules with specializ¬
ed functions eventually joined
together, making a kind of molecular
collectivity the first cell.
By three thousand million years ago,
a number of one-celled plants had join¬
ed together, perhaps because a muta¬
tion prevented a single cell from
separating after splitting in two. The
first multi-cellular organisms had
evolved. Every cell of your body is a
kind of commune, with once free-living
parts all banded together for the com¬
mon good. And you are made of a hun¬
dred million million cells. We are, each
of us, a multitude.
Sex seems to have been invented
around two thousand million years
ago. Before then, new varieties of
organisms could arise only from the ac¬
cumulation of random mutations the
selection of changes, letter by letter, in
the genetic instructions. Evolution
must have been agonizingly slow. With
the invention of sex, two organisms
could exchange whole paragraphs,
pages and books of their DNA code,
producing new varieties ready for the
sieve of selection.
By one thousand million years ago,
plants, working co-operatively, had
made a stunning change in the environ-

ment of the Earth. Green plants
generate molecular oxygen. Since the
oceans were by now filled with simple
green plants, oxygen was becoming a
major constituent of the Earth's at¬
mosphere, altering it irreversibly from
its original hydrogen-rich character
and ending the epoch of Earth history
when the stuff of life was made by non-
biological processes. But oxygen tends
to make organic molecules fall to
pieces. Despite our fondness for it, it is
fundamentally a poison for un¬
protected organic matter.
The transition to an oxidising at¬
mosphere posed a supreme crisis in the
history of life, and a great many
organisms, unable to cope with oxy¬
gen, perished. A few primitive forms,
such as the botulism and tetanus
bacilli, manage to survive even today in
oxygen-free . environments. The
nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere is
much more chemically inert and
therefore much more benign than oxy¬
gen. But it too is biologically sustained.
Thus ninety-nine per cent of the
Earth's atmosphere is of biological
origin. The sky is made of life.
For most of the four thousand
million years since the origin of life, the
dominant organisms were microscopic
blue-green algae, which covered and
filled the oceans. Then, some six hun¬
dred million years ago, the monopoliz¬
ing grip of the algae was broken and an
enormous proliferation of new
lifeforms emerged, an event called the
Cambrian explosion.
Life had arisen almost immediately
after the origin of the Earth, which sug¬
gests that life may be an inevitable
chemical process on an Earth-like
planet. But life did not evolve much
beyond blue-green algae for three thou¬
sand million years, which suggests that
large lifeforms with specialized organs
are hard to evolve, harder even than the
origin of life. Perhaps there are many
other planets that today have abundant
microbes but no big beasts and
vegetables.
Soon after the Cambrian explosion,
the oceans teemed with many different
forms of life. By five hundred million
years ago there were vast herds of
trilobites, beautifully constructed
animals, a little like large insects. They
stored crystals in their eyes to detect
polarized light. But there are no
trilobites alive today; there have been
none for two hundred million years.
The Earth used to be inhabited by
plants and animals of which there is to¬
day no living trace. And of course every
species now on the planet once did not
exist. There is no hint in the old rock of
animals like us. Species appear, abide
more or less briefly, and then flicker
out.
Before the Cambrian explosion
species seem to have succeeded one
another rather slowly. But after the
Cambrian explosion exquisite new
adaptations followed one another with
comparatively breathtaking speed.
In rapid succession, the first fish and
the first vertebrates appeared; plants,
previously restricted to the oceans,
began the colonization of the land; the
first insect evolved, and its descendants
became the pioneers in the colonization
of the land by animals; winged insects
arose together with the amphibians,
creatures something like the lungfish,
able to survive both on land and in the
water; the first trees and the first rep¬
tiles appeared; the dinosaurs evolved;
the mammals emerged, and then the
first birds; the first flowers appeared;
the dinosaurs became extinct; the
earliest cetaceans, ancestors to the
dolphins and whales arose, and in the
same period the primates the
ancestors of the monkeys, the apes and
the humans. Less than ten million years

Life has existed on earth for four thou¬
sand million years. For about half of that
time organisms reproduced themselves
by cell division which only rarely pro¬
duces new life forms by accidental muta¬
tion. The emergence of two sexes and
sexual reproduction, which made possi¬
ble the exchange of huge amounts of
genetic Information, was responsible for
the dazzling variety of life forms and
species In the world today. Sex as a

ago, the first creatures who closely
resembled human beings evolved, ac¬
companied by a spectacular increase in
brain size. And then, only a few million
years ago, the first true humans
emerged.
There are tens of thousands of
millions of known kinds of organic
molecules. Yet only about fifty of them
are used for the essential activities of
life. The same patterns are employed
over and over again, conservatively, in¬
geniously, for different functions. And
at the very heart of life on Earth the
proteins that control cell chemistry and
the nucleic acids that carry the
hereditary instructions we find these
molecules to be essentially identical in
all the plants and animals. An oak tree
and I are made of the same stuff. If you
go far enough back, we have a common
ancestor.
On another planet, with a different
sequence of random processes to make
hereditary diversity and a different en¬
vironment to select particular combina-

tions of genes, the chances of finding
beings who are physically very similar
to us is, I believe, near zero. The
chances of finding another form of in¬
telligence is not.
If there are intelligent beings on the
planets of fairly nearby stars, could
they know about us? One way would be
to listen with large radio telescopes.
Today there is a vast international
radio, television and radar communica¬
tions traffic. At some radio frequencies
the Earth has become by far the
brightest object, the most powerful
radio source, in the solar system
brighter than Jupiter, brighter than the
Sun. An extraterrestrial civilization
monitoring the radio emission from
Earth and receiving such signals could
not fail to conclude that something in¬
teresting had been happening here
lately.
Overall, the most pervasive and
noticeable source of radio transmis¬
sions from the Earth is our television
programming. Because the Earth is
turning some television stations will
appear at one horizon of the Earth
while others will disappear over the
other. There will be a confused jumble
of programmes. Even these might be
sorted out and pieced together by an
advanced civilization on a planet of a
nearby star.
The most frequently repeated
messages will be station call signals and
appeals to purchase detergents,
deodorants, headache tablets and
automobile and petroleum products.
The most noticeable messages will be
those broadcast simultaneously by
many transmitters in many time
zones for example, speeches in times
of international crisis by world leaders.
The mindless contents of commercial
television and the integuments of inter¬
national crisis and internecine warfare
within the human family are the prin¬
cipal messages about life on Earth that
we choose to broadcast to the Cosmos.
What must they think of us?
