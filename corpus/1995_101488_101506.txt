questions.
Four thousand years ago the
Egyptians were already
successfully farming Tilapia
or "Nile carp" (Oreochromis
niloticus). It is still a highly
regarded species: about 500,000
tonnes of it are produced world¬
wide today. Carp-raising has been
a part of Chinese and Vietnamese
traditions for centuries.
Aquaculture, which was
rediscovered in the 1960s as a
weapon in the fight against
hunger, is the raising of fish, mol¬
luscs, crustaceans and plants
either in salt or fresh water. By
1990 fish were providing about
15 per cent of the protein con¬
sumed worldwide. The United
Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) estimates
that by the turn of the century
fish produced by aquaculture
will comprise up to 20 per cent
of the world supply of fish and
will be the major source of pro¬
tein in developing nations.
While the world harvest from
capture fisheries has barely
increased since 1988 (rising 0.5
per cent between 1990 and
1991), aquaculture production
has grown steadily since 1984
(doubling between 1984 and
1992) with an annual growth rate
of 9 per cent. Global fish produc
tion reached 98.1 million tonnes
in 1992, 13.9 million tonnes (9.4
million tonnes offish and 4.5 mil¬
lion tonnes of molluscs and crus¬
taceans) of which came from
aquaculture.
To maintain the current level
of world fish consumption, i.e. an
average of 13 kg per head per
year, until the year 2010, 91 mil¬
lion tonnes of edible fish will have
to be produced to feed the
earth's projected population of 7
billion. In other words the pre¬
sent level of aquaculture produc¬
tion will have to be doubled. This
is an attainable goal. Yet contrary
to what might be thought, fish¬
farming is not easy, especially if
the need to protect the environ¬
ment is taken into account.
CAPTIVE CATFISH
The advantages of expanding
aquaculture are obvious. At the
same time, the different systems
used, ranging from small-scale
fish farming to high-yield indus¬
trial plants, pose numerous prob¬
lems. A 1989 report produced by
the Organization of Economic Co¬
operation and Development
(OECD) asked a number of
important questions. Is there a
risk that fish farming will modify
natural populations and reduce
biological diversity? Is it wise to
introduce exotic species? Might
not fish farming cause the spread
of disease? What effects might
waste deposited in lakes, rivers
and coastal zones have in the long
term? What happens to chemical
products such as antibiotics that
are used in aquaculture? Are fish
farming zones wisely chosen? Is it
possible to predict the impact of
aquaculture on the environment
by using computer-generated
models?
Let us look at the example of
Viet Nam, where fish are farmed
in ponds (64 per cent), rice pad¬
dies (21 per cent) and floating
cages in rivers (15 per cent) and
the exploitation of water
resources makes a major contribu¬
tion to the economy. The continent
of which Viet Nam forms part is,
moreover, the runaway champion
in aquaculture. Asia supplies 84
per cent of world production, fol¬
lowed by Europe (8.5 per cent),
North America (3.7 per cent),
South America (2.3 per cent), the
former Soviet Union (0.9 per cent)
and Africa (0.5 per cent).
A single species of catfish
(Pangasius bocourti, ca ba sa in
Vietnamese) constitutes almost
three-quarters of floating-pen
35

production in Viet Nam, where
most fish farming is concentrated
in the Mekong Delta region. Until
recently supplying the farms with
young fish meant taking ten to fif¬
teen million young fish from their
natural hatcheries in the Tonle
Sap ("great lake") of Cambodia
during the rainy season (July to
November). The disadvantages of
this system are obvious. A natural
habitat is depopulated and the
source of supply depends on the
political relations between two
countries. Last May scientists
from the Continental, Mediter¬
ranean and Tropical Aquaculture
Group (GAMET) in Montpellier
(France) succeeded in getting the
catfish to reproduce in captivity.
This is a momentous development
for Vietnamese fish-farming,
especially since the price of
young fish fluctuates widely.
The fish are raised in pens
that float under houses. They are
fed with a paste made of rice-
bran and fresh fish, and are also
given human and animal refuse.
Aquaculture is a profitable way
of using wastes.
CULTURE AND AQUACULTURE
Surprisingly, in both Viet Nam
and China, where this technique
began, ponds used as latrines or
fertilized with manure prove to
be excellent for fish-farming.
Jerome Lazard, head of the
"Aquaculture and Fish Pro¬
gramme" in the department of
farming and veterinary medicine
at France's Centre for Interna¬
tional Co-operation in Agronomic
Research for Development
(CIRAD) says that there is no risk
of fish transmitting disease-
bearing germs to people if the
fish are left to swim freely in
clean water for a few days in
order to cleanse themselves both
inside and out. Lazard regrets
that this process is not practised
widely enough. Although con¬
sumers say they do not want to
eat these "dirty fish", the
130,000 tonnes (minimum) pro¬
duced in this fashion find buyers
nevertheless.
"Wherever ponds can be cre¬
ated," says Jerome Lazard, "they
constitute wonderful fish produc¬
tion facilities, since they blend
perfectly into agricultural produc¬
tion systems by helping to improve
water quality and by using various
by-products and wastes." The
ideal thing is to dig ponds just

and chicken coops or even to raise
these structures onto piles, which
solves the problem of effluents.
The droppings are nutritious to
the plankton that the fish feed on.
Fish canneries provide
another propitious environment,
for fish are very fond of fish! It
takes one kilo of fish in the form
of meal or oil to produce a kilo of
edible fish. The fish-meal is made
from less appetizing species and
is also used to feed pigs and fowl
and for making surimi, a kind of
fish paste. But since it takes at
least five kilos of fish to make a
kilo of fish meal, supplies of this
food source may eventually
dwindle and thus encourage over¬
fishing.
In order to be viable, the use
of ponds for fish farming must be
culturally acceptable. Writing in
the FAO review, Ceres, Peggy
Polk pointed out that in Africa,
"when experts suggested that
farmers raise fish in the small
ponds used to water cattle and
supply household water needs,
many local people rejected the

idea, insisting the fish would
muddy the water and make it
unsuitable for drinking". In India
it is standard practice to add fer¬
tilizer to water tanks being used
for aquaculture except in
Madhya Pradesh State where
people refuse to allow the fertil¬
ization of water tanks because
they use the same water for
cooking and bathing.
The farmed species also must
be acceptable to prospective con¬
sumers. In some parts of
Colombia, for example, people
traditionally do not eat dorado.
HOOKED ON PROFIT
Profit is probably the most dan¬
gerous bait for the fish-farmer
who is indifferent to the equilib¬
rium of ecosystems. In the 1980s
there was a boom in demand for
the Penaeus monodon shrimp in
the Gulf of Thailand. It was easy
to make a fortune. All it took was
the cash to buy a piece of man¬
grove swamp or to build a grow-
out pond in the estuary of a river.
People said there was more
money in shrimp farming than in
illicit drugs! Between 1983 and
1988 aquaculture in Asia grew at
the rate of 40 per cent a year.
Then, in 1989, 80 per cent of the
farms located near Bangkok,
where most of the activity was
concentrated, went bankrupt.
There were several reasons for
this, including a drop in demand
on the world market, reduced
profit margins and polluted water
due to poor effluent management.
(Dumping too much organic
matter reduces its oxygen con¬
tent, and untreated urban efflu¬
ents carry diseases and promote
the proliferation of algae that are
toxic to fish and humans alike). A
similar collapse had taken place
for similar reasons in Taiwan two
years before. Epidemics had
been caused by over-stocking the
ponds and there had been "mis¬
management of the pond
ecosystem", indiscriminate use of
antibiotics and chemicals and the
use of polluted water. The
results have been disastrous.
Vast areas of mangroves have
been destroyed in Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand.
A NEW KIND OF LIVESTOCK
In Europe, especially in Norway,
future candidates for aquacul¬
ture are cod, halibut, turbot,
catfish, lobster and scallops
raised in pens, tanks and, for
certain species like cod and
salmon, by sea-ranching.
Fish fanners use techniques
comparable to those that have
been used for years in animal hus¬
bandry. The salmonids are being
used as guinea-pigs for aquatic
biotechnology, which was the
subject of an OECD report in
1994. ' The fish are not only oper¬
ated on and vaccinated but also
fertilized, sterilized, made to
grow and even change sex. Scien¬
tists are trying to develop salmon
capable of living in the cold polar
waters by implanting the genes
that code for the anti-freeze pro¬
tein into its genome. They have
also injected the growth hormone
gene from the rat into trout, carp
and salmon. In other words, trans¬
genic fish now exist. What will
happen if they escape from their
pens and mingle with their kind
in nature? Fortunately the
greater the genetic difference
between organisms, the less
capable they are of fertilizing
each other.
Another way of obtaining
monosex or male fish (which grow
twice as fast as females) is by
administering "masculinizing"
steroids. "This technique, which
is forbidden in Europe, is widely
used in Asia (Taiwan and the
Philippines) and in Israel," notes
Jerome Lazard with some con¬
cern. "It releases some thirty by¬
products into the water, and we
don't really know its ecological
consequences." Nonetheless,
research is continuing to make
great strides and some concrete
results have already been
obtained. A natural hormone that
is as effective as the artificial
hormone but much easier for fish
to absorb is now available. It is
possible by using heat treatment
to change the sex of young fish
without harming the environ¬
ment. These are some of the
avenues that tomorrow's fish
farmers will be exploring.
