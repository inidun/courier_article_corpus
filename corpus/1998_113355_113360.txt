Fighting for recognition
Though officially recruited by
school parents’ associations,
community mothers are in fact
drawn from the ranks of very needy
women who offer their services to
regional ICBF offices which are
eager to expand their  network
q u i c k l y, even if it means dealing
later with problems of quality.
Several h o b i s (welfare centres) are
required to make up a parents’
a s s o c i a t i o n . The mothers can
legally stand for election to an
a s s o c i a t i o n ’s committee but ICBF
officials usually frown on this. I n
the early years in some regions,
they even openly opposed it and
refused to hire some women who
were elected. It took many years of
struggle before the mothers won
recognition from ICBF officials.
Parents and mothers often argue
about how to use ava i l a b l e
r e s o u r c e s. Some mothers have
accused heads of parents’ associa-
tions of dipping their fingers in the
k i t t y, not replacing worn-out uten-
s i l s, being unwilling to guarantee
loans to improve their premises,
and charging a new recruit  an
entrance fee when her predecessor
has left without paying back her
l o a n .
At first there was a big turnover
among the poorest mothers. Th e y
were drawn more by the chance of
a house improvement loan than by
the job itself, which proved more
thankless than they imagined, a n d
many left soon after being recrui-
t e d . E v e n t u a l l y, things settled
d o w n , after the mothers won
battles for social security coverage
and for better training and working
c o n d i t i o n s.
The mothers were quick to set
up their own organizations to press
for improvements in the pro-
g r a m m e. The ICBF was cautious at
first about this unionization and
stressed publicly that the mothers
were volunteers or employees of
the parents’ associations and that
their salary was a bonus.
The mothers retorted that 
the ICBF could not duck its respon-
s i b i l i t i e s, since it has chosen to
define even the smallest details of
the rules, closely monitoring time-
t a b l e s, meal menus, w o r k i n g
m e t h o d s, p u n c t u a l i t y, numbers pre-
s e n t , hygiene and budgetary mat-
t e r s, leaving very little to the
mothers and parents.
So a union soon sprung up,
along with an association called
A m c o l o m b i a . G r a d u a l l y, r e g i o n a l
associations grew up and dialogue
developed between the two sides.
This is how the mothers won the
rights they enjoy today. ■

Many community mothers are recruited from among the very poor.
