THE ARCHITECT :
A MODERN SCAPEGOAT
reflections of a Soviet architect
on the merits of old and new styles
FELIX A. NOVIKOV, a leading Soviet
architect, has designed such major buildings
as the Palace of Pioneers in Moscow and
the Institute of Electronic' Technology In
Zelenograd, near Moscow, for which he was
awarded the State Prize ol the U.S.S.R.
in 1975. He is also the architect of the Soviet
embassy now being built in Mauritania,
and has recently completed a book. The Blue
Bird of Architecture.
IT is fashionable nowadays to cri¬
ticize architects. In fact this is
nothing new: it may be recalled that
even the Eiffel Tower once scandaliz¬
ed people, even some whose names
are still respected, and it would not
be surprising to learn that some 25
centuries ago the people of Athens
were extremely annoyed about the
building of the Parthenon.
Yet, seen from our own viewpoint,
the environment wljich our predeces¬
sors succeeded in creating seems to
have been a truly humane and harmo¬
nious one.
We cannot say the same about our
own architecture, which is full of con¬
tradictions and gives plenty of ob- ,
vlous grounds for acute public dis- ^
satisfaction. Since this dissatisfaction r
15

¡sa fact, and since it is general, it
might be useful to try and understand
its nature.
Why are people dissatisfied ? What
don't they like In present-day town-
planning? And If there really is a
problem, how can It be solved?
There seems to me to be two types
of problem Involved: the first are
purely consumer problems, which can
therefore be fairly clearly* defined and,
given the requisite economic efforts,
successfully dealt with, while the
others are aesthetic problems and as
such entirely a matter for the archi¬
tectural profession, problems which It
is up to the architect himself to solve.
But all too obviously, architects are
not always capable of dealing with
them, indeed many of them think it Is
none of their business.
If only modern society put as much
creative effort into its buildings as it
does Into Inventing machines, if peo¬
ple would only acknowledge that hou¬
ses are more Important than cars, then
architects could again play an Impor¬
tant role in society. Failing this, peo¬
ple will feel increasingly drawn to the
architectural past, comparing the
present unfavourably with It.
The American architect, Peter
Blake, has remarked that old buildings
converted to new purposes are far
more popular these days than modern
architecture employing the latest tech¬
niques. The Architectural Institute In
Pennsylvania, which has moved into
an old training college for dentists, Is
far better, he says, than Paul Rudolf's
spectacular creation at Yale. Simi¬
larly, the French critic Pierre Schnei¬
der argues that the best thing for a
young architect to do would be to re¬
fuse to create new buildings and to
look for ways of using old ones while
they are still useable.
I think that this' undisguised pre¬
ference for old buildings and the
attraction widely felt towards every¬
thing antique represent a natural
reaction against the soulless, machine¬
like character of many present-day
structures. It Is true that people have
always admired the old masters and
always cherished antiques and heir¬
looms, but has this admiration of
antique objects ever been carried to
such lengths?
Have people ever before gone as
far as to mass-produce furniture, do¬
mestic utensils and jewellery that are
pure and simple fakes? This must be
because people want some compen¬
sation for. what modern architecture,
the entire artificial environment, has
so far not always been able to pro¬
vide. Certainly, architects too can pas¬
tiche the styles of the past but sham
architecture is far dearer to produce
than other kinds of fake.
Modern architecture draws criticism
because it is predominantly and aus¬
terely functional. The vast majority of
modern buildings flaunt their con
nexion with engineering, and strive
to exhibit their structure and the tech¬
niques used In their construction.
But for architecture this is not
enough. It has another, a social func¬
tion. The primacy of technology
seems as It were to wrest architec¬
ture away from the spiritual founda¬
tion on which it has stood since time
immemorial. The modern preoccupa¬
tion with technique, if carried to ex¬
tremes, becomes almost inhuman.
The time has therefore come to huma¬
nize architecture.
But perhaps there Is more to It than
that. Architectural development is cy¬
clical in a search for new inspira¬
tion, in a break with traditional forms,
architects often turn to the past.
These are the swings of the pendulum
of history: Renaissance architects
were inspired by antiquity, the Em¬
pire style was influenced by the ar¬
chaeological investigations carried
out during Napoleon's Egyptian cam¬
paign, and perhaps we, too, are today
at a point where the pendulum Is be¬
ginning to swing back towards an in¬
terest in the architecture of the past.
People have very likely grown some¬
what tired of the headlong forward
rush so characteristic of our age.
This is very probably the case. It Is
significant that Unesco's cultural pro¬
gramme includes "study of traditional
forms of architecture In order to use
them in modern conditions".
AT any point in the development
of society, man Is caught be¬
tween past and present, yet in art and
particularly in architecture the past,
even the very distant past, often
appears more accessible than the fu¬
ture. Reproduced in architecture, the
past Is recognizable. For this reason
alone It Is able to evoke familiar ¡ma¬
ges, more readily acceptable than
¡mages of an as yet unknown, unfa¬
miliar future.
Society, however, Is forward-look¬
ing. There are always creative artists
who respond to this challenge that,
too, is traditional. Although the future
Is frightening because of Its unfami-
llarity, at the same time it exercises a
certain power of attraction. Even in
the distant past, new ideas were
never Immediately accepted, and they
never will be. Yet the brighter signs
of the future exert a powerful attrac¬
tion, finding supporters, winning over
the leaders of taste and ultimately
gaining acceptance.
What has tradition got to do with
all this?
Max Frisch, an architect who built
a number of important buildings in
Zurich before embarking on his lite¬
rary career, puts the following words
Into the mouth of one of his charac¬
ters: "What In fact does tradition
mean? I think it means solving the
problems of our time no less boldly
than our forerunners solved theirs.
Everything else Is stylizatlon, mummi¬
fication" (1).
I am all for the programme of
"studying the traditional forms of
architecture", but apprehensive of
"using them in modern conditions"
lest their "use" be understood in a
purely mechanical sense.
Tradition, I am convinced, means
more than just the actual forms of past
ages, otherwise we should have to
renounce all the technical advances
of modern times and go back to
craftsmen making architectural details
In the classical style unless we are
supposed to mass-produce Corinthian
capitals, to use modern technology to
reproduce the traditional forms by the
dozen.
The problem is of course much
more complex, which is probably why
there are so many different attitudes
to it, including the attitude of reviva¬
lists who would trick out modern
structures with traditional forms so
that they remain In keeping with the
historical environment and the natio¬
nal traditions.
But there Is also another way to
create new, modern forms that de¬
velop the characteristic features of the
native architecture. I think that here
technology can only serve as a means
to an end. It is quite obvious today
that technology, no matter how ad¬
vanced, cannot of itself solve the
problem of modern architecture.
Those who believe scientific re¬
search can produce prescriptions for
a harmonious environment are in my
opinion mistaken. I offer my definition
of architecture in the form of the fol¬
lowing equation: architecture =
(science + technology) x art. No
matter what the value of the sum-
mands "science" and "technology",
no positive result can be obtained If
the factor "art" is nil.
Are we not asking too much of our
architects? It is also a tradition to
complain about them, as I mentioned
earlier. It is just that the contradic¬
tions have never before been of such
gigantic proportions. But then all fi¬
gures today are astronomical; our age
is an age of quantity.
This is why I think that if we archi¬
tects carefully and conscientiously
counted up all the magnificent build¬
ings that have been built in the world
In recent years, we should discover
that never before were so many archi¬
tectural masterpieces created. But
since ours is an age of large numbers,
never has the shortage of good archi¬
tecture been so great either.
There is one important point to be
made here. We always judge the past
by Its highest achievements, whereas
we judge the contemporary environ-

"A city without old
buildings is like a man
without a memory"
goes the saying.
This spired tower and
wooden house serve

of a new town in

former village around
which their high-rise
dwellings have
mushroomed.
ment as a whole, taking the good with
the bad. This, of course, is only na¬
tural. I believe that if a town has at
least one beautiful building to its
name, it can consider itself lucky
by no means every town can claim as
much.
Soviet society makes strict demands
on Its architects. It criticizes them for
faceless, monotonously similar build¬
ings, but at the same time picks out
and generously rewards those that
reveal real architectural talent. State
prizes are awarded annually for out¬
standing achievements in architecture,
just as in literature, music, art and the
theatre.
In spite of all, I feel sure that our
age too, will be fondly remembered,
and that our descendants will want to
protect the many eloquent testimonials
tö our creative talent which we leave
behind us. And not orfly because our
descendants will be kinder to us than
we have been to our predecessors:
modern architecture has already pro¬
duced, and will certainly produce
many more.outstanding buildings that
not only reflect ¡or develop previous
traditions, but also create new ones,
and therefore hold out great promise
for the future of architecture.
