As we move from the industrial to the infor-
mation age, access to the global information
infrastructure for economies, companies and
individuals becomes paramount.
The debate about the we l fare implications of
the inform ation revolution for developing coun-
tries has given rise to diametrically opposed views.
Some believe that inform ation and communica-
tions technologies (ICT) can be mechanisms
enabling developing countries to “leapfrog”stages
of deve l o p m e n t . O t h e rs see the emerging global
information infrastructure as contributing to even
wider economic divergence between deve l o p i n g
and industrialized countri e s. The reality is more
complex.
A number of trends are broadly recognized as
the hallmarks of the inform ation age. F i rs t , I C T
p r o gress is expected to continue to promote the
p r o l i f e r ation of communication networks as the
costs of delivering these networks decline and the
quality of their services improves.
S e c o n d , in a networked env i r o n m e n t , the incen-
t i ves for specialization and outsourcing increase.
This puts a premium on flexibility and responsive-
ness as business cycles shorten and interactions
between producers and consumers expand.
T h i r d , electronic commerce is expected to
continue to expand rapidly and further contribute
to the internationalization of service activities.
Fo u rt h ,i n f o rm ation flows are at the ve ry core of
the globalization process as countries and corp o r a-
tions project power by promoting their own cul-
ture and values on a global basis.
Will the networked economy widen or narrow the gap between
developing and industrialized countries?

These trends suggest that the countries that are
better positioned to thrive in the new economy are
those that can rely on: widespread access to com-
munication networks for their companies and citi-
z e n s ; the existence of educated labour-force and
consumers;and the availability of institutions that
promote knowledge creation and dissemination.
Against this background,developing countries
seem to be at a significant disadvantage vis-à-vis
i n d u s t rialized countri e s. According to the Wo r l d
B a n k , by 1995 low-income economies averaged less
than 2.6 telephone lines per 100 inhabitants and
less than two computers per 1,000 inhabitants, in
contrast to a teledensity of 54.6 per 100 and a com-
puter penetration of 199 per 1,000 in high-income
economies. Internet penetration is even more ske-
wed with the ten top countries (all of them indus-
trialized economies) accounting for more than 85
per cent of the existing worldwide Internet hosts
by the end of 1997.
Income inequality
and computer literacy gaps
The quality and coverage of schooling at all leve l s
are also characterized by significant gaps betwe e n
i n d u s t rialized and developing countri e s.These gaps
reinforce income inequality, not only intern at i o n a l l y,
but also within each nation as the ratio of female to
male illiteracy tends to be higher the lower the leve l
of economic development and the benefits of public
e d u c ation are typically skewed toward the ri c h e r
c l a s s e s.The gaps are even more dramatic when trans-
l ated to the field of computer literacy.
F i n a l l y, d e veloping countries are ill equipped
to implement pro-competitive regulatory regimes.
In the same ve i n , the culture of protection and
enforcement of intellectual property rights is often
an alien concept.The same applies to reliance on
n e t works to promote transparency and access to
government services.
All these indicat o rs seem to point towards a
social transformation that will increase rather than
diminish economic divergence at the international
l e ve l .D e veloping economies would be condemned
to fall further behind in the intern ational econo-
mic race because of their lack of connectivity and
ability to transform the inform ation explosion into
a knowledge revo l u t i o n . Once one analyses the dri-
vers of the information revolution,however, a dif-
ferent picture begins to emerge.
Te c h n o l o gical developments are rapidly ero-
ding economic and technical barriers to entry into

c o m m u n i c ation netwo r k s. D e veloping countri e s
c a n , for example, leapfrog stages of deve l o p m e n t
by investing into fully digitized networks rather than
continuing to expand their outdated analog-based
infrastructure.There are advantages in being a fol-
lower—e.g.,not having to cope with the technolo-
gical obsolescence of well developed wireline net-
works—and they are illustrated by the fact that
l ow-income economies presented a higher share of
digital telephone lines (94.7 per cent) than high-
income economies (85.5 per cent) by 1996. ICT
are also creating new development opport u n i t i e s
to address some of the handicaps of deve l o p i n g
countries noted above.
F i rs t , by developing a modern inform at i o n
i n f r a s t ructure countries can reduce isolation and
e x c l u s i o n . M a ny countries are experiencing fa s t
expansion of cellular telephony as an alternative to
inefficient conventional network services.Wireless
technology can also provide affordable connecti-
vity to rural areas in a fraction of the time that was
required in the past to expand conventional tele-
phone netwo r k s. In Bangladesh, for example,“ w i r e-
less wo m e n ” were gi ven loans of $350 each by Gra-
meen Bank to cover the initial costs of the
t e l e p h o n e , connection and training.They have now
become service prov i d e rs in the rural areas. M o r e o-
ve r , community inform ation centres with access to
value-added services can be customized to the
needs of the poor. In South A f ri c a , for example,
such centres are being used to provide access to the
Internet and to help answer questions concerning
health,employment,and human rights issues.
S e c o n d , c o u n t ries can accelerate educat i o n a l
d e velopment by using their inform ation infra-
s t ructures for distance educat i o n . The costs and
e f f e c t i veness of such programmes are improv i n g
d r a m at i c a l l y. ICT is also being used for lifelong
learning, opening opportunities for new players in
e d u c ation systems. In developing economies, t h e
dynamism of these new entrants can challenge
conventional educational systems and play a cata-
lytic role in their transformation.
Leapfrogging stages
of development
T h i r d , a modern inform ation infrastructure can
also be a powerful force for better governance. It
c a n , for example, enhance tax administrat i o n ,a u d i-
ting and control. Morocco has significantly impro-

ved its tax revenue by computerizing the country’s
tax administrat i o n . M o r e ove r , c o u n t ries can now
automate their institutions administering intellec-
tual property rights, strengthening their efficiency
and enforcement capability at a fraction of the costs
that prevailed in the past.
In short , the logic of the networked economy is
one of inclusion rather than one of exclusion. A s
technological progress continues to push the costs
of computing and bandwidth down,opportunities
for development-oriented applications of ICT will
m u l t i p l y. M o r e ove r , for those already connected
the value of the network increases exponentially as
new participants join the community.
Technological determinism
and government policies
These considerations point toward a more opti-
mistic scenario for developing countri e s ’p a rt i c i p a-
tion in the emerging knowledge economy.
A l t h o u g h , no doubt, income and wealth inequality
m ay increase in the initial stages of the process,
c atch-up can also happen at a much faster pace
than in the past.ICT spending, for example, grew
more quickly in most developing regions than in
high-income economies in the 1992-97 peri o d .A n d
c o u n t ries like South A f rica and Brazil already boast
a higher share of networked personal computers
than most industrialized economies.
These scenarios can be criticized for sharing a
common feature: technological determinism.The
different outcomes predicted, h owe ve r , i l l u s t r at e
that they are also influenced by other variables, in
particular,government policies.
If, for example,developing countries maintain
regulatory barriers to the expansion of networks—
e.g., by favouring monopolistic providers for tele-
com services—the likelihood of the first scenari o
i n c r e a s e s. In this case, global dualism will be magni-
fied not only across the conventional North-South
d i v i d e , but also in terms of country - l e vel economic
inequality as a small elite of connected people in the
South benefit from the global inform ation infra-
structure.
On the other hand, if regulat o ry roadblocks are
properly addressed and efforts to promote univer-
sal access to value-added networks and computer
literacy are implemented,then the possibilities for
catching up will proliferate. Participation in multi-
l ateral effort s — e . g . ,n e g o t i ations conducted under
the World Trade Organisation and the World Intel-
lectual Property Organization—can also be used
to leverage the process of institutional moderniza-
t i o n . Under these circumstances, the benefits of the
r e volution will be widely disseminated both at
national and international levels.
The most likely outcome, h owe ve r , is a combi-
n ation of both scenarios in which a subset of deve-
loping countries is able to converge with high-income
economies more quickly than ever before while
o t h e rs lag further behind. I n t e rn ational efforts to
promote pilot projects in this field can increase the
number of countries in the first cat e g o ry. ■
