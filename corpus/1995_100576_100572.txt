The Babelsberg
Many of the stars of German
í cinema were born at the leg¬
endary Babelsberg Studios
outside Berlin. The first
studio was built there in
1912 its walls constructed entirely of
glass on a 40,000-square-metre site acquired
the year before by the Bioscop film com¬
pany. In the next eighty years some 2,500
films would be made at Babelsberg.
Among those who helped to make the
name of the new studios were the actress Asta
Nielsen, Paul Wegener, director of Der
Golem (1915), and Ernst Lubitsch, who pro¬
duced seven films there in 1918, including his
first international success, Carmen, with Pola
Negri. Two great directors whose careers were
closely associated with Babelsberg in the
1920s were Fritz Lang (Metropolis, 1927) and
Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau (Nosferatu, 1922).
Germany's first sound stages were built at
Babelsberg in 1929, and in 1930 The Blue.
Angel was made there with Marlene Dietrich
and Emil Jannings in the leading roles.
After the nationalization of the German
film industry in 1938-1939, Babels.berg fell
under the control of Nazi Propaganda Min¬
ister Josef Goebbels and his machine. By
then the industry was already suffering from
the exodus of talent which began in the early
1930s when directors such as Lang and Dou¬
glas Sirk fled the Nazi regime and went to
America.
After the Second World War, the state film
company DEFA Film AG was established at
Babelsberg and went on to produce over 700
features, including 150 films for children.

Studios
Between 1959 and 1990, the studio made over
600 TV films. Since 1992 the sound studios
have been renovated as part of a large-scale
investment programme and an international



centre of multiple media activities is being set
up. Today Babelsberg (which attracted over
500,000 visitors in 1994) is on the way to
becoming a veritable media city with com¬
mercial, service and educational facilities,
hotels, cinemas and restaurants. N. T.
