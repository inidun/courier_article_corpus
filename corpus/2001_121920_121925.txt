The state: rising from below?
Grassroots organizations might be filling in for failed states, but for 
the rule of law to take effect, government and communities have to
work hand-in-hand

A
t the beginning of the 20th century,
l e s s than a tenth of the world’s
population lived in countries that were
i n d e p e n d e n t .To d a y,the United Nations
counts 189 member states and nearly all
human beings live under the rule of a sovereign state
recognized by the international community. B u t
d o e s this make these states legitimate in the eyes
o f their citizens and do they fulfill what is expected
of them?
In 46 of the 144 countries and territories covered
in the latest Amnesty International annual report,
armed groups are killing civilians,torturing people and
seizing hostages. The state is not fulfilling its main
r e s p o n s i b i l i t y, namely keeping a monopoly on the
use of legitimate force.
Human rights violations, crime and purely
predatory behaviour prevail: many states are
instruments with which a minority robs the people,
instead of returning tax money in the form of services.
C l e a r l y, in these cases, the state is a thief —nothing
m o r e, nothing less. In others, rule of law might exist,
but it goes unenforced because states lack the means
to carry out their most basic mission.
Faced with such a vacuum or coercive context,
citizens can respond by falling back on their “ s o c i a l
capital”—namely their desire to pull out of the
situation by setting up grassroots organizations. A
group of people starts a process of material
i m p r o v e m e n t , focused on combating poverty. Th e y
also spark a revival of identity, since they take charge
of their lives in accordance with their traditions and
k n o w l e d g e.L a s t , they set in motion a political process
through the flourishing of local participatory
d e m o c r a cy.
So is this gradual expansion of local power and
autonomy the real way to build —this time from the
bottom-up—a new kind of state in tune with people’s
needs and expectations? One that is inevitably
different from the model “ i m p o r t e d ” from rich
c o u n t r i e s ?
Community self-government has two obstacles
that only the intervention of the state,however absent
or unsympathetic it is, can overcome. Fi r s t , a
neighbourhood must be developed in accordance
with the infrastructure and regulations controlled by
public authorities so that it fits in with what is
happening in adjoining areas. S e c o n d , i n e v i t a b l e
c o n flicts between the various local parties involved can
be democratically resolved only within broader
institutions that  the state can provide.
To build strong and legitimate states where none
e x i s t , two approaches must work together:one from
the “bottom-up”—making use of social capital that
often lies untapped—and the other from the “ t o p
d o w n ,” in the form of a state that fulfils its
r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s. ■
