HANS
CHRISTIAN
ANDERSEN
'Scissor fantasies'
for gingerbread
The Unesco Courier. August 1957
Hans Christian Andersen could
do amazing things with a pair of
scissors. It was the queer
deftness of his huge hands which was
partly responsible for his mother's
determination to make him
a tailor in his early youth.
In his autobiography, The
True Story of My Life, the
Danish author of The Ugly
Duckling and other immor¬
tal fairy tales recalls that
"I spent my time over my
peep show and my puppet
theatre, and my greatest
happiness consisted in col¬
lecting bright pieces of
cloth and silk which I cut
out myself and sewed. My
mother regarded it as a
good exercise preparatory to
my becoming a tailor."
In Copenhagen and else¬
where he later delighted
children by cutting fantas¬
tic figures dancers, swans,
storks and castles out of
paper as rapidly as he talk¬
ed. One midsummer eve¬
ning, his biographer Signe
Toksvig relates, he was
sitting in a country inn in
Sweden by the clear bright¬
ness of Lake Siljan when
the little granddaughter of
his hostess ran in, eager to
have a look at his coloured carpet-bag,
Scotch plaid, and the bright red lining
in his small trunk. Quickly he seized a
sheet of paper and cut out a whole
Turkish mosque, minarets and windows,
and she ran happily out with it. Soon
he saw a crowd of men and women in
the yard standing around the girl's
grandmother who was holding the mos¬
que over her head, out of reach of the
child. A few minutes later, the grand¬
mother came to Andersen's room with
a plateful of gingerbread in various
shapes.
"I bake the best gingerbread in
Dalarne," she said, "but the shapes are
old. The gentleman cuts out such
beautiful things. Might he not be able
to cut us some new shapes?"
Bewitched by her pleading and by the
polite Swedish use of the third person,
Andersen stayed up almost the entire
Northern midsummer night and cut out
shapes for gingerbread: nutcrackers with
long boots, windmills that
included the miller, men in
slippers with a door in the
stomach, dancers who
pointed a leg skywards. The
old woman was delighted.
"New shapes they will be,"
she chanted, "but difficult !"
Andersen also liked to
draw and did it fairly well,
though with a little stiffness.
He has left a number of
albums filled with little
drawings, little verses and
soft sentiments about
muses and poetry (he
always considered him¬
self a poet even after
gaining fame with his
children's tales). Most are
sketches he made during his
trips to Elsinore, to Flor¬
ence, Rome and other
places in Italy, or are sou¬
venirs of his voyages to
Turkey and Germany. Hans
Christian Andersen suffered
great privations in his youth
but in later life he was
honoured by kings, queens,
poets and scholars who vied
with one another in sharing his company.

the little town in Denmark where Hans
Christian was born.
