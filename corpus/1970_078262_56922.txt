THE YEAR
OF THE WHALE'

T
HE moot point is whether
Leviathan can long endure so wide
a chase and so remarkable a havoc;
whether he must not at last be exter¬
minated from the waters, and the last
whale, like the last man, smoke his last
pipe and then himself evaporate in the
final puff."
These prophetic words of Herman
Melville, the author of "Moby Dick"
and himself an experienced harpoonist,
strike home uncomfortably in a decade
which may see the final extinction of
the blue whale, the largest mammal
ever to inhabit this world.
In thirty years the total blue whale
population of the world's oceans has
dropped from 100,000 to 1,000. Four
other species of whale are now being
caught at a rate faster than they can
reproduce.
This is but one more example of
man's incredible failure to respect the
ecological system of which he is a part
and his wanton destruction of the
world's natural assets that have served
him so well In the past.
We have only to consider the pro¬
ducts that man derives from whales to
realize how misguided it is to permit
the overfishing of these valuable
beasts. For centuries whale oil lit
men's homes, whale meat provided an

of whaling, men pitted themselves against

SAFARI AT SEA
The pith helmet and bush
jacket of the rich, dilettante
big-game hunter have been
replaced by the sea-boots and
oilskins of the millionaire
who wants to boast about
the size of the whale he
caught and the even bigger
one that got away. Already
threatened with extinction
by the legitimate whaling
industry, the world's largest
creatures now have to
contend with the "kill for a
thrill" brigade. Above, a
"sportsman" administers the
coup de grâce to a sperm
whale off the Azores.

Certain species on the road to extinction
Important source of food, and whale¬
bone, inserted in women's corsets,
moulded women's figures to conform
to the dictates of fashion.
In more modern times whale oil is
used in the quenching and rolling of
steel, as an extreme pressure lubricant,
for the dressing of leather, in the manu¬
facture of soap and candles; whale
meat meal is used for cattle cake and
poultry food, frozen whalemeat is
widely eaten by humans, especially in
Japan; bone meal and guano, meat
extracts and liver oil rich in vitamin A
are other by-products; ambergis is
still of importance in perfumery and
whalebone is still used for corsets
and for bristles on industrial brushes.
The vast size of whales (a blue whale
can measure up to 100 ft in length and
weigh as much as 176 tons or roughly
the equivalent of 2,000 men) has
always aroused human curiosity and
given rise to a wealth of legends
from the adventures of Jonah in the
Bible to. Herman Melville's Moby Dick.
Writers from classical times, such as
Aristotle and Pliny, wrote of the
smaller whales, the dolphins, who were
considered to be the friends of man,
and there are many tales of tame dol¬
phins who carried boys upon their
backs. Among Spanish and Portu¬
guese fishermen there is a persistent
belief that dolphins attack sharks and
drive them away.
Stone Age man probably hunted the
smaller whales and dolphins. Eskimos
and American Indians are known to
have gone whaling with primitive wea
pons made of horn, flint and slate.
One Alaskan whaling settlement cer¬
tainly dated back to 100 or 200 A.D.
The Alaskan Eskimos' whale cult
dance indicates how important the
whale was in their lives. Before sett¬
ing out on a whaling expedition a week
would be spent in ritual dance with a
woman taking the part of the whale;
during the hunt, incantations were
made and songs sung; after a success¬
ful hunt the Shaman, or high priest,
would lead the dance of rejoicing; this
would be followed by a 3 day "mourn¬
ing" period of placation, after which
came a final feast accompanied by
frenzied dancing.
Modern whaling methods really date
from the 1860s, when a Norwegian
sealing captain, Svend Foyn, invented
a new technique for hunting the great
rorquals, including the blue whale,
which swim too fast for pursuit in open
boats. He fitted a harpoon-firing
cannon in the bows of a steam vessel
and incorporated into the harpoon
head a grenade which exploded a few
seconds after the harpoon had pene¬
trated the whale's body. Foyn's
methods revolutionized whaling and
have remained essentially unaltered to
this day.
The next big change in whaling came
in 1925, when the steamship "Lanc¬
ing" was fitted with a slipway in the
stern by means of which whales could
be hauled aboard. This marked the
beginning of the factory ship era and
opened the way to pelagic (open sea)
whaling.
Factory ships could operate for long
periods wherever whales were to be
found and outside territorial waters in
which regulations to curb overfishing
were gradually being imposed.
Delivered to the factory ship by a
whale catcher, the huge carcass is
winched up the slipway to the flensing
(butchering) deck where the blubber is
removed in enormous strips and the
meat removed and the carcass dis¬
membered. It takes little more than
45 minutes to dispose of a 100 ton
blue whale.
For a time pelagic whaling was un¬
restricted, but it soon became evident
that blue whales and humpback whales
were being seriously overfished. In
1937 and 1938 the governments of
Great Britain, Norway and Germany
signed agreements to restrict pelagic
whaling and in 1946 the International
Whaling Commission was set up which
most whaling nations joined.
The Commission lays down minimum
lengths for whales that may be caught,
limits the duration of the whaling sea¬
son for the different species, allocates
areas outside the Antarctic in which
factory ships may operate and has
named a sanctuary area in the Antarc¬
tic which can be opened or closed
to whalers at its discretion. Whaling
for humpback whales was completely
forbidden in 1963 and for blue whales
in 1964.
Many experts, however, consider
that existing regulations for the control
of whaling are still inadequate. In
his remarkable book "The Year of the
Whale (1)," biologist Victor B. Schef-
fer has called for much stronger Inter¬
national action. He would like to see
control of whaling placed in the hands
of the United Nations and firm action
taken before certain species of whale
become entirely extinct.
His pleading is based on sound com¬
mon sense. "If we think of whales, not
as unique systems, but as packages
of oil and protein, we can get along
nicely without them," he says. He
points out that we could instead gather
the sea forJder on which they live, but,
"it will not come to us in the whole¬
sale, bargain size of the fifty ton
whale."
"The Year of the Whale" is a fic¬
tionalized account of the first year in
the life of a sperm whale, interspersed
with absorbing facts about the biology
of the whale, the whale at play, its
ability to pick up the "tingling mes¬
sages" of vibrations and interpret
them, the whaling industry and all the
folklore and mysticism that surrounds
the whale.
But more than this, Scheffer has the

knack of presenting hard biological
facts in terms of sheer poetry as wit¬
ness this description of a female
sperm whale diving to the ocean
depths to feed.
"Too long she has dozed in the
winter sun, only inches under the sur¬
face of the sea. She sighs. She
draws a dozen deep drafts of air and
then she turns below. Her tail flashes
against the blue. She does not sink,
she undulates, she presses firmly
down. Her heartbeat drops to ten per
minute, barely thumping, slow, pump¬
ing five gallons at a stroke. The blood
retreats from limbs and skin and tail;
it keeps alive the massive brain and
heart. The red-black muscles of her
flesh begin to pour their hidden stores
of oxygen into her veins. Now the mas¬
sive beds of fat begin to serve. Their
spongy, oily cells relax and offer up
their air. The pressure grows. She
continues down. Her body goes in
debt for exygen, but not for long. A
trillion cells suspend, they tolerate,
they hold. For half an hour she feeds
and then she pushes to the top to
breathe. Her lungs are clean and
fresh; their walls are thin. In sweet
abandon she sucks the upper air all
pure and unpolluted. Her breath is a
rustling sound like surf on a smooth
beach a soft sighing music of the
wind. It is a sound like no other on
the sea. She has fed two thousand
feet below and yet survives."
In passages such as this Scheffer
succeeds in imparting to us the won¬
der of a sadly depleted life system.
Before depletion becomes extinction
and before the genetic pool of our
ecosystem is further reduced we must
surely listen to the voice of reason and
act to preserve this branch of our own
family of mammals.
In their ancient whale cult dance
the Alaskan eskimos were instinctively
aware of this and marked the death of
a whale with a "mourning" period.
Unless we act immediately the mourn¬
ing period will become unending.
As Albert Schweitzer wrote in his
autobiography; "...man comes again
and again into the position of being
able to preserve his own life only at
the cost of other life. If he has been
touched by the ethic of Reverence for
Life, he injures and destroys life only
under a necessity which he cannot
avoid, and never from thoughtlessness.
So far as he is a free man he uses
every opportunity of tasting the bles¬
sedness of being able to assist life and
avert from it suffering and destruc¬
tion."
