The Sisyphus
of democracy 
fter the coming
to power in 1989
of the Eastern
B l o c ’s first non-
c o m m u n i s t
g o v e r n m e n t
since  World War
I I , Poland was
quick to learn the game of democracy.
Twelve years after the “ Ve l v e t
R e v o l u t i o n ,” most of Central and
Adam Michnik:
Whether as a dissident or editor-
in-chief of Poland’s leading daily
newspaper, Adam Michnik has
never ceased to stir up debate.
How does he see democracy
in Europe, over a decade after the
fall of the Soviet empire? 
A
Eastern European countries are
d e m o c r a c i e s. But democracy here is
a i l i n g. Fi r s t , because our democratic
structures are young, weak,lacking in
tradition or a political culture. But also
because western democracy is ailing.I n
both places, corruption is inherent to
the system. In the Po l i s h , C z e c h ,
Hungarian and Slovak democracies,
this scourge has happened on a more
serious scale than in western countries,

“D e m o c racy does not claim infallibility.
We a p o n s can be replaced by a rg u m e n t s”
A THOUGHTFUL INSURGENT
From inside his feverish lookout,a tiny office cluttered with paper in Warsaw, Adam Michnik,
54, has never stopped being a dissident.With his fine, acerbic writing,he opposes populism
and criticizes Catholics seeking to set up a new moral order. And he does it with humour. His
newspaper has become Poland’s leading daily because, he says, “I haven’t managed to drive it
completely into bankruptcy.”
In 1989, he founded Gazeta Wyborcza (“Electoral Gazette”), “the first free daily between the
Elbe and Vladivostok,” to support the independent trade union Solidarity during the first free
elections in the history of the communist bloc. The Berlin Wall was still standing.Right from the
start, the newspaper declared its independence from political movements and trends. Michnik,
who was elected to parliament, advocated “shock therapy” for Poland—a radical overhaul of
the economy—and urged everyone to take part in building democracy. That is when he parted
ways with Lech Walesa, the historic leader of Solidarity and future president.
For Michnik, thought and insurrection have always gone together. He was a student leader in
1968, a co-founder of the KOR (Workers’ Defence Committee) and an adviser to Solidarity.
Altogether, he spent six years behind bars. His struggle and achievements have earned him many
rewards. ■



where democracy has struck deeper
r o o t s. But the nature of the problem is
the same.And corruption remains the
overriding challenge to the democratic
order.
Was it this “ n o r m a l i t y ” of a western-
style democracy that you aspired to
when you were in the underg ro u n d
opposition?
Not really! But all is not lost! Th a n k
God we have a free press. We can
expose a scandal every day. I t ’s a
complex struggle. But when all is said
and done, I would rather suffer
corruption in democracy than
corruption in dictatorship. Our role at
the G a ze t a, where I’m editor in chief, i s,
of course, to defend freedom and truth,
but also to exercise the power of the
p r e s s. We keep a close eye on the
g o v e r n m e n t . We fuel the debate on
democratic values, national traditions,
the legacy of history, t o l e r a n c e.We also
think of the excluded: the poor,
religious and ethnic minorities. For us,
working at the G a ze t a is a way of
pursuing what we did in the democratic
opposition during communism.
O n c e, the dissidents of Central and
Eastern Europe made their voices heard
in the West.This is no longer the case.
Because our fight has become an
everyday struggle! We ’re no longer
talking about the “ final reckoning.”
During the dictatorship, the main
difference between us and
revolutionary movements was that we,
the anti-communist opposition, did not
harbour any illusions about the “ u t o p i a
of a perfect society.”
P e r s o n a l l y, I believe in T h e
Unperfect Society, to borrow the title of
a book by Milovan Djilas.That’s why I
don’t feel any great disillusion.Maybe
you idealists in the West do! But
Western intellectuals have made a
specialty of placing their hopes in the
Viet Cong, Fidel Castro, Mao Zedong,
the Soviet Union, the Sandinistas of
Nicaragua and I don’t know what else.
Our movement—that of
C z e c h o s l o v a k i a ’s Vaclav Havel,
R u s s i a ’s Andreï Sakharov, S o l i d a r i t y —
did not strive for utopia. What we
wanted was a return to “ n o r m a l i t y.” O f
c o u r s e, we idealized western democracy.
Today we’re more familiar with the
system and its weaknesses. But that
h a s n ’t kept us from fighting, in the
moral sense of the term, a g a i n s t
c o r r u p t i o n ,unemployment and poverty,
and for the construction of a fairer
s y s t e m . But one specific feature of that
struggle is that it will never be over. It
is endless, like Sisyphus in hell,
constantly pushing his huge boulder up
to an unreachable hilltop.
You often sing the praises of grey… 
The world of dictatorship was in
black and white. It was a struggle
between Good and Evil, between total
Truth versus absolute Lies.You had to
be an idiot or a hoodlum to dare be
against it. Democracy is qualitatively
d i f f e r e n t . I t ’s a world of clashing
v i e w p o i n t s, fragmentary and confli c t i n g
interests where the overriding colour
i s g r e y. I t ’s an endless search for
c o m p r o m i s e, eternal imperfection…
D e m o c r a cy does not claim infallibility.
Weapons can be replaced by arguments.
It’s an alternative to civil war. In that
s e n s e, the Basques’ terrorist attacks
against the Spanish state, which is a
perfectly democratic state, a r e
unacceptable.
Twenty years ago, on December 13,
1 9 8 1 ,G e n e ral Jaruzelski declared martial
l a w.You and thousands of other people
w e re arre s t e d . What gave you the
courage to act and keep on going?
For my generation, the road to
freedom began in 1968.While students
in Paris and Berkeley were rejecting
bourgeois democracy, we in Prague or
Warsaw were fighting for a freedom
that only the bourgeois order could
guarantee. In appearance, everything
divided us.
But something brought us together:
the need to rebel stemming from the
conviction that,as long as the world is
the way it is, i t ’s worth not dying a
peaceful death in your bed. Here, we
were the first generation able to build
projects for the future and those
projects were not groundless, a s
subsequent events showed. Th e
situation did change after a few years.
Many factors came into play at the
same time.Poland was going through a
deep economic crisis. The changes

taking place in the Soviet Union also
had an impact. Lastly, the communist
n o m e n k l a t u r a itself was evolving,
becoming more pragmatic. It was the
end of the utopian dream, and it
enabled us to dismantle the
dictatorship by negotiation.The “ r o u n d
t a b l e ” [negotiations between the
g o v e r n m e n t , the opposition and the
Church in 1989] was our great
contribution to 20th-century history!
Admit that it is extremely rare to see
opposition forces and leaders of the
dictatorship—put another way,
prisoners and their guards—sitting
down at the same table to negotiate a
Often after a period of dictatorship, a
f ree press is tempted to settle score s
and take some kind of re v e n g e. Did that
happen in Poland? 
We played our role and helped to
shed light on some of the dictatorship’s
criminal secrets. But our philosophy is
just the opposite of the spirit of
r e v e n g e. We ’re for reconciliation,
because it’s impossible to take a step
ahead when you’re looking back. To
move from dictatorship to democracy,
we campaigned for compromise and
national reconciliation: with neither
r e p r i s a l s, nor winners and losers.
Reform in Poland would have been
impossible without that social
c o n s e n s u s, without dialogue and
c o m p r o m i s e. The way I see it,
“ d e c o m m u n i z a t i o n ,” d i s c r i m i n a t i o n
against former civil servants or party
a c t i v i s t s, would have been anti-
d e m o c r a t i c. On the other hand, w e
wanted the truth to come out,and felt
that task was up to historians and
j o u r n a l i s t s, rather than prosecutors and
police officers.Amnesty doesn’t mean
amnesia.
Is that why you wanted to broach a
dialogue with General Jaruzelski? 
I wanted to behave like a normal
human being in a free country: I had
been his unrelenting opponent, h i s
p r i s o n e r,but I was interested in what he
had to say. H e ’s an intelligent man and
decolonization and democratization
pact. That did not happen in Franco’s
S p a i n , H o n e c k e r ’s East Germany,
P i n o c h e t ’s Chile or even in Kadar’s
Hungary.
Talking together to bring a country out
of dictatorship is a good way to learn
about democratic compromise.
Today in Poland, no political force
openly contests the democratic order.
When they’re in power, it’s clear for all
the parties, whether they’re post-
communist, right-wing or centre-right,
that democracy is a stable, reassuring
system.
On air with General Jaruzelski (right) in 1992.

“The old split between l e f t and r i g h t e n d e d
with the anti-communist re v o l u t i o n”
Poland’s roads to freedom sometimes
took very different courses.Some went
through prison, others through the
corridors of power. Deep down, I ’ m
convinced Jaruzelski is a Polish patriot
and a partisan of democracy. He’s not
a cy n i c. He didn’t want to turn
communism into a rampaging
chauvinism,like Serbia’s Milosevic or
C r o a t i a ’s Tu d j m a n , who ripped the
Balkans apart in the 1990s. He didn’t
want to build his own identity by
stirring up hatred among others, t h o s e
who belong to a different ethnic group,
religion or class.N o. I’m sure he always
wanted to build a non-ethnic, secular
Po l a n d . That is very similar to what
w e ’ve always stood for at the G a ze t a: a
state for all citizens.
We must reject one camp’s
domination over another, with endless
settlings of scores. Our country must
make room for everybody. That’s the
only way to build a sovereign,
democratic state.
Soon Poland will join the Euro p e a n
Union. But Europe is in crisis, and has
botched reforms considered necessary to
expand and integrate newcomers.
The debates in the European Union
pit two fundamentally different views
against each other: the idea of a E u r o p e
of Nations defended by de G a u l l e
[president of France from 1959 to
1 9 6 9 ] , and the notion of a federal
Europe of regions that Denis de
Rougemont1 put forward in his book
Open letter to Europeans. I and the
people of my generation are closest to
the Gaullist position. Each nation’s
culture has something sacred about it in
its heart.And for my generation,that
sacred something is independence.We
have a hard time letting go of that.
Although we’re told it’s worth the
s a c r i fic e, our emotions stand in the way.
More generally, the fall of communism
has led to a thaw in Western Europe.
Beneath the ice, we have seen both
flowers and signs of decay appear:
crises that jeopardize the cohesiveness
of states and of Europe.
Western democracies are facing other
p ro b l e m s, such as the weake n i n g
o f t raditional intermediaries—tra d e
u n i o n s, political parties—between
government and the people. I t ’s as
though heads of state now find
themselves alone in front of television
and its omnipotence.
We ’re seeing the same
phenomenon in Poland and don’t have
any solutions to fight it.It strengthens
politicians’ temptation to offer populist
r e c i p e s, and we’re afraid of being swept
away by this groundswell. But it goes
further than the simple perverse effect
of television or the triumph of a certain
n i h i l i s m . Politics itself is undergoing
an upheaval.The old split between left
and right has had its day. That rift,
which was created by the Fr e n c h
R e v o l u t i o n , came to an end with t h e
anti-communist revolution.To d a y, t h e
new fault line runs between those who
defend the idea of an open,
multicultural society based on human
rights and the rights of citizens, a n d
those who are rebuilding walls around
a closed society, stone by stone.
Whether we are talking about the
M a a s t r i c h t2 treaty or NATO
intervention in Ko s o v o, t r a d i t i o n a l
political divisions no longer fit in with
the new world’s real needs. This can
be seen with all the major issues: w h i c h
Europe should be built? What should
be religion’s role in public life? What is
the right vision of the state:an ethnic
state, a religious state or the opposite,

a citizens’ state? What policy should
be adopted towards asylum-seekers or
immigration? Recently, a debate over
the Jedwabne massacre has rocked
Poland.A historian revealed that the
1,600 Jews in this village under German
occupation in 1941 were slaughtered by
their own neighbours. In Poland, this
debate has been as violent as the
D r e y f u s3 affair in Fr a n c e. It has deeply
divided families and the country. And
there again,the fault line does not run
along the old rift between left and right,
but between advocates of an open and
a closed Poland.
The vision that everyone has of
the nation in Europe has also come
into play. Are we eternally innocent
victims or accomplices in the
subjugation of others, whether they
were Ukrainians, Jews or even
Germans,against whom we practised
a form of ethnic cleansing after Wo r l d
War II.The defenders of an “ e t e r n a l l y
innocent” Poland include right-wing
e x t r e m i s t s, post-communists and
b i s h o p s. I t ’s a dangerous concept.Th e
Serbs have always considered
themselves eternal victims as well.
Today they’re paying the price.
“A n t i - g l o b a l i z a t i o n ”d e m o n s t rations also
reflect a whole range of opinions. How
do you interpret them? 
What is globalization? Internet,
mobile phones, open borders? I’m
afraid that fear is leading new
volunteers to enlist under the banner
of new ideological crusades. Th e s e
people say they’re “ p r o - p o o r,” b u t
they are not campaigning to open up
the markets of rich countries in
Europe and America to products
from the developing world. They’re
not debating reform of the IMF or
the World Bank. That would be too
s p e c i f i c, too down to earth. L i k e
Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Joschka Fi s c h e r
and Rudi Dutschke in 1968, they’re
fighting in the name of certain
r e v o l u t i o n a r y - c o m m u n i s t ,a n a r c h i s t ,
s i t u a t i o n i s t , Maoist or Tr o t s k y i s t
utopias. I can understand them. But
today we are well aware of these
utopias’ genuine nature: t h e y ’r e
stupid. To me, the anti-globalization
movement is more the symptom of a
crisis of thought. ■
