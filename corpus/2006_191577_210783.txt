the saCred Wood 
of madagasCar’s ZafImanIry
                            the Zafimaniry of madagascar do more than sculpt wood. 
                  they inscribe their entire cosmogony on this sacred material. 
                             In 2003, unesCo proclaimed their tradition a masterpiece 
                                     of oral and intangible heritage.
The Zafimaniry are the last to practice woodworking.

Deep in the heart of the Tanala 
forest in south-east Madagascar, 
Antoetra lives in drizzle and fog 
for much of the year. The village 
has no particular charm. Yet the 
region’s inhabitants are willing to 
walk for as long as four hours to 
get to its weekly market. 
Once there, throngs of kids guide 
the visitor around the houses and 
workshops where the famous 
sculpted rosewood chairs are

700 square kilometers  
encompassing about  
100 villages.

sold, and also stools, honey pots 
and diverse sculpted chests, re-
nowned as far away as Scandina-
via and Japan. 
Antoetra is the main gateway to 
Zafimaniry country, an area of 700 
square kilometers encompassing 
about 100 villages, the most re-
mote of which is a ten-hour hike 
away. This community of 25,000 
is the last to practice woodcraft, 
previously widespread on the is-
land. 
The elaborate tradition, transmit-
ted from one generation to the 
next, is visible on every construc-
tion and object made of wood, 
even the most ordinary. In 2003, 
it was proclaimed a masterpiece 
of oral and intangible heritage by 
UNESCO. 
A few hours on foot from Antoetra, 
the village of Sakaivo emerges 
from the mist. Traditional wooden 
houses are built on both sides of 
a stream and a few rice paddies. 
It is said they once covered all the 
central highlands, where construc-
tions in pisé, cob or brick have 
now replaced them. 
Mr Rakoto, a reputed carpen-
ter, takes me to see one of his 
“creations”. While a cabinetmaker 
smoothes a plank, helped by an 
adolescent, he explains that a 
Zafimaniry house requires three 
months of work and is assem-
bled only with planks and pegs, 
without a single nail or other metal 
hardware.
Complex 
symbolism
On doors and windows you dis-
cover the finely chiseled geometric 
motifs for which the Zafimaniry are 
famous. The symbolism marked 
in the wood is in fact a reflection 
of their beliefs. The spider’s web 
pattern stands for family ties, while 
the honeycomb represents com-
munity life. 
And that’s not all. The houses 
are actually built in accordance 
with even more erudite rules. From 
their orientation in the heart of the 
village to the lay-out of the only 
room, it is the entire Malagasy cos-
mogony that is represented in the 
four directions, or the four major 
destinies. 
The founder of the line always 
takes his place in the village’s 
most sacred angle, the north-east. 
As for the oldest son, he takes the 
space just below his father while 
the youngest has to settle farther 
to the south-west, the entirely pro-
fane angle. 
Similarly, inside the house, the 
bed is in the north-east while the 
entrance and the unimportant ob-
jects are placed in the west. Each 
of the 20 different species of wood 
used by villagers is reserved for a 
specific purpose.
A threatened 
culture
But today this culture is endan-
gered. Following food shortages 
in the 1950s, the Zafimaniry be-
gan selling their crafts, but they 
have not succeeded in making 
their trading profitable, unlike the 
distributors of their products, nor 
have they been able to prevent 
counterfeiting. 
In addition, with the growing 
deforestation of the region, they 
have begun to run short of raw 
material and are turning to other 
activities, such as slash-and-burn 
shifting cultivation, which fur-
ther aggravates the deforestation 
problem. 
In the end, young people tend to 
go look for work in town or in the 
shipyards, becoming part of the ru-
ral exodus and the disintegration of 
Zafimaniry identity. 
This is why UNESCO has 
launched an action plan aimed at 
protecting the community’s natu-
ral environment and monitoring 
the transmission of traditional tech-
niques. It is a way to preserve the 
knowledge acquired down through 
the centuries by the Zafimaniry, 
“descendants of those who desire”.
