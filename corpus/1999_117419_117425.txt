Facts about A i d s
Aids—acquired immunodeficiency syndrome—is
caused by the human immunodeficiency virus
( H I V ) , which weakens the body’s immune system.
Once they have an established HIV infection, i n d i v i-
duals are infected for life and will probably succumb to
serious opportunistic infections caused by the weake-
ning of their immune system. Treatment with antiretro-
viral drugs can slow the progression of HIV infection
but these expensive medications are not available to
most people in the developing world, who often lack
access even to drugs that combat opportunistic infec-
t i o n s. In individuals who do not get antiretroviral the-
r a p y, the time between infection with HIV and the
development of the serious illnesses that define Aids is
around eight years, and most patients do not survive
much more than two years after their onset.
HIV spreads through unprotected sex (intercourse
without a condom), transfusions of unscreened blood,
contaminated needles (most frequently for injecting drug
u s e ) , and from an infected woman to her child during pre-
gnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.
HIV is a slow-acting virus.The majority of infected indi-
viduals look healthy and feel well for many years after
i n f e c t i o n ; they may not even suspect they harbour the
virus, though they can transmit it to others. Conservative
UNAIDS estimates are that 90% of all HIV-infected people
worldwide do not know they have the virus. A laboratory
blood or saliva test is the only certain way to determine
whether an individual is HIV-positive. n

Some two decades after the virus started to
s p r e a d , HIV/Aids is a gr owing crisis dispro-
p o rt i o n ately weighing on youth and on the
d e veloping wo r l d .About a third of the 33.4 million
people world-wide living with HIV are aged 15-24,
and half of all new HIV infections occur among this
gr o u p. F i ve young people are infected eve ry minute.
F u rt h e rm o r e , studies in A f rica show girls have four
or more times the infection rate of boys.
The developing world accounted for 95%,and
Sub-Saharan A f rica alone for 70% of new HIV
infections in 1998.Aids is now the biggest killer in
A f ri c a . Nine out of ten HIV infections among chil-
dren under 15 last year occurred in A f ri c a .I n fa n t
m o rtality in some A f rican countries rose as much
as 150% in 1998 alone. Life expectancy is fa l l i n g
by as much as 20 ye a rs as a result of A i d s.The cri s i s
is also having an impact on economic deve l o p m e n t ,
with many A f rican companies saying Aids illness
and death costs sometimes total more than corpo-
r ate profits. Elsewhere too the crisis is gaining
gr o u n d . In A s i a , of the 7.2 million people living with
Aids,a fifth were infected last year.
W h at is perhaps most startling is that HIV is
expected to gather force as a killer. In 1990 it
accounted for 8.6% of adult deaths from infectious
diseases in the developing wo r l d .By 2020, t h at fig u r e
is expected to rise to 37.1%. n
