UNESCO’s approach to sport is summed up in its 1978 International Charter of Phy-
sical Education and Sport .These activities, the Charter say s ,“should seek to promote
closer communion between peoples and between individuals,together with disinte-
rested emulat i o n ,s o l i d a rity and frat e rn i t y, mutual respect and unders t a n d i n g, and full res-
pect for the integrity and dignity of human beings.”
The promotion of ethical values—especially to combat margi n a l i z ation and vio-
lence—is central to this approach. It stresses the necessity for sport to be open to eve ryo n e ,
starting with young people who are all too often sidelined because they are physically or
mentally disabled, because they live in problem areas or just because they are female.
UN E S C O’s focus is on promoting sport for all. It believes that in a society in which people
need to be equipped for lifelong learning, sport can make a vital contribution to educa-
t i o n . For education invo l ves much more than spoon-feeding inform at i o n . Its ultimate pur-
pose is to stimulate people’s capacity to think,create and interact with others and to use
this capacity in order to be self-reliant, while also helping others to improve their we l l - b e i n g
and quality of life.Sport is an incomparable way of achieving these aims.
We live in a world where the gap between rich and poor keeps on gr ow i n g . On the sport s
fie l d , or failing that , in streets, c o u rt ya r d s , or fie l d s , such differences disappear like magi c.
People compete against each other, but they also get together in teams, using weapons that
are for once entirely peaceful: s p e e d ,s t r e n g t h ,s k i l l , endurance and intelligence—qualities
that have nothing to do with social status.
We live in a violent world.In cities, where two-thirds of humanity will soon be living,
e ven young children go out onto the sports field bu rsting with the aggression they have accu-
m u l ated in their daily live s. And here too, a kind of miracle takes place and the aggr e s s i o n
is transformed.Its negative and destructive charge is transmuted into a positive desire to
beat one’s opponent—not to achieve victory at all costs and by any means, but fairly, in
a contest governed by rules that both sides observe.In these conditions sport becomes a
school where people can give vent to their aggressive instincts and at the same time learn
tolerance and respect for others.Those who practice sport become aware of forces which,
if they are not curbed,might blindly take over their lives.
We live in a world of wo rsening nat i o n a l , ethnic and religious antagonisms.The capa-
city of sport to unite people—almost to weld them together—is obvious these day s. It cul-
m i n ates in the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup, which have gi ven the world so
m a ny ennobling images of comradeship. Our pleasure is all the gr e ater because it is
shared on an unprecedented scale. No other modern social event makes people feel so
strongly that they belong to a global village.
But unfort u n ately there is more to sport than this.S p o rt is not monolithic: it takes many
f o rm s , and is ri ven by differences and disagr e e m e n t s.When sport hits the headlines it does
not always glorify the heroes who have won our admiration by their performances on the
field.Behind the scenes, but increasingly in the spotlight,is a world of wheeling and dea-
l i n g, d ru g - t a k i n g, and athletes who are subject to premature specialization and intolerable
s t r e s s. B a r b a ric chauvinism takes over when public opinion and the enthusiasm of support e rs
are fired up to fever pitch.
In poor countries, four out five young people still have no access to adequate sports
facilities and training.The stakes are so high in big sporting events that only the results count:
the purpose of sport goes by the board.The designation of winners and losers is more impor-
tant than bri n ging together athletes to compete under a set of ru l e s.This is a far cry from
the “ h a p p i n e s s ” e voked by the French poet Paul Verlaine—the happiness of “ p e a c e
without victory”. n

We live in a world where
the gap between rich and
poor keeps on growing. On
the sports field, or failing
that, in streets, courtyards,
or fields, such differences
disappear like magic.
