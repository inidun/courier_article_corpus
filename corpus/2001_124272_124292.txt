INTERVIEW BY SOPHIE BOUKHARI
UNESCO COURIER JOURNALIST



Tune into the “ n e w
conscience of Islam”
There is a reformist current in Islam, one that takes a critical approach to its origins. For Moroccan
philosopher Abdou Filali-Ansary*, if Muslims had more room to freely debate issues, religion and
politics might no longer be so closely entwined
ince the 19th century, many Muslim thin-
ke rs have sought to “ re f o r m ” I s l a m i c
t h o u g h t . But their efforts have hard l y
led to modern Muslim re g i m e s.Why not?
When there’s a crisis, people tend to
go back to their roots. In the 19th cen-
tury, the reform movement was very
strong because, with the colonial
c o n q u e s t s, modernity suddenly burst
into dar el-islam, the “house of Islam.”
Modernity meant people changing
their relationship with both the world
and themselves. For the first time,
through science, they realized that
many things, such as certain weather
patterns or illnesses, were not a matter
of fate. The social order no longer
seemed impossible to change either.
Revolutions could sweep away des-
pots and people could improve their
living standards.
From India to North A f r i c a , a great
wave of thinkers arose to declare that
Islam, in its earliest form, was in fact
moving towards this powerful moder-
n i t y. But Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani in
I r a n , Mohammed Abduh in Egypt and
others didn’t follow the example of
Christian reformers, who swept away
previous interpretations in order to
look at the scriptures themselves with
a fresh eye.These intellectuals regarded
the history of the first Muslims as a
reference point, on par with the Ko r a n
and the S u n n a h (see glossary p. 4 1 ) .
Their return to the roots of Islam was
d e f e n s i v e. They wanted to reassure
Muslims, to boost their confidence by
telling them that their religion favoured
progress.

recent history of Islamic thought came
later, in the 1920s, with a schism in the
reform movement. On one side was
Hassan el-Banna,an Egyptian famous
for founding the Muslim Brotherhood,
and on the other, Ali Abderraziq,also
from Egypt, who was the forerunner
of the critical movement within Islam.
Having translated his work, I can
say he was the first one to go back to the
roots with a critical eye. He empha-
sized that the basic tenets of Islam,
obedience and consultation, are not
r u l e s of political organization but
m o r a l v a l u e s. In return for being
o b e y e d , a person with responsibilities—
f a m i l y, business or political—must
a v o i d making decisions alone like a
tyrant and take into account the views
of those he leads. Abderraziq showed
t h a t while the Islamic political order is
built by Muslims, there is no religious
duty to do so.You can see there’s a big
difference.
But the Prophet Mohammed founded
an Islamic city that has fuelled the ima-
ginary universe of Muslims.Wh a t ’s more,
he was a warrior himself.
What the Prophet founded at
Medina wasn’t a political entity. It was
a religious community. Mohammed was
born in a society where there was no
s t a t e.The tribes were constantly at war
with each other, except for four months
of truce every year. He tried to preach
in this environment for 10 years but
the only followers he drew were the
rejected—the slaves, women and mino-
rity tribes. So he left for Medina in 622
(in the Hegiran calendar), where he
managed to reconcile two enemy tribes
and set up the first Muslim community.
It was a sort of anti-tribe, which ruled
out identifying oneself with a particular
c l a n .You joined it because you wanted
to become a Muslim,by simply taking
an oath (a profession of faith). But this
community was attacked by other tribes
and the Prophet had to defend himself
and become a warrior.
At the time of his death,Arabia had
embraced the new religion and he was
planning an expedition to bring the
new message to Syria. The circum-
stances of history made Medina a
centre of religious proselytism. But the
orders Mohammed left behind were
c l e a r : never use force to convert people.
But there is a very violent verse in the
Koran which says: “So when the sacred
months have passed away, then slay the
i d o l a t e rs wherever you find them, a n d
t a ke them captives and besiege them
and lie in wait for them in every ambush.”
Ye s, that s u r a is very violent indeed.
It was revealed to the Prophet in a war
s i t u a t i o n , when the polytheists were
threatening the very survival of the
M u s l i m s.Alongside this verse,I ’d quote
another of the Prophet’s command-
m e n t s :“ B e w a r e, respect people, do not
rip up trees, burn houses or rape
women.” This is what drew people to
Islam.
After Mohammed died in 632, t h e
Muslim community became a pro p e r
state.
Muslims were immediately divided
over this. Those who defended an
empire (caliphate) led by a chief
“elected” by an assembly, carried the
d a y.The supporters of A l i , who wanted
a state run by the Prophet’s family,
created Shiism. But a third branch is
always forgotten. These were the ear -
liest Muslims, such as Malik ibn
Nuwaira and Abu Dharr, who said:
“We’re a religious community, so why
set up a state?”They were executed or
forced out. Over the centuries, m a n y
thinkers who’ve taken up their ideas
have met the same fate. Their history
has never been written.
Why not?
No authority allowed it. In the 20th
century, the critical movement conti-
nued to be sidelined but it stayed alive.
Ali Abderraziq has had many spiritual
h e i r s, such as Mohammed Mahmud
Taha in Sudan, who was hanged by
Sudanese President Jaafar el-Numeiry
in 1985 and whose writings sell tens of
thousands of copies. Today you have
the Tunisians Mohammed Talbi and
Abdelmajid and Mohammed Charfi,
and in Pakistan Fazlur Rahman and
Abdul Karim Surush in Iran. They all
point out that advocates of the “ s t a t e ”
triumphed for historical reasons and
based themselves on one of many pos-
sible interpretations of the canonical
t e x t s. O b v i o u s l y, these people don’t go
out and kill….
But leaving history aside, t h e re are
sizeable obstacles to criticism of the
Ko ra n , such as its “ u n c re a t e d ,”b a s i c a l l y
divine nature.
This notion developed much later,
three or four centuries after the Pro-
p h e t ’s death. It began as a minority
view but the theologians who argued
for it were so badly persecuted that
they won the support of the masses and

so managed to impose it. Even more
important is the fact that the famous
concept of sharia, conceived as a law
which is meant to govern every aspect
of a believer’s life, took shape nearly
200 years after the Prophet’s death.
This must be stressed because it marked
an extremely important break with the
p a s t . It was established by Mohammed
Ibn Idriss Shafi’ i , a brilliant young intel-
lectual born 150 years after the Pro-
phet died. Early Islam only talks about
hudud (limits and restraints) imposed
by God, rather like the commandments
not to kill people or seize women.
Islamic jurists draw on it in different
ways to give laws and customs an
ethical basis. But Shafi’i went much fur-
ther and used the h u d u d in the Koran to
come up with rules for every aspect of
human behaviour.
At every stage in Islam’s history, i t ’s
always the hardliners who win.Why?
Because very early on, p o l i t i c s
seized on religion and subsequent reli-
gious debate was always dominated by
political considerations and “ i n s t r u-
mentalized”for partisan ends.
Let’s talk about this modern fundamen-
talist branch of Islam born in the early
20th century, at opposite ends of what
you call the critical movement.Why has
it been so popular?
Fundamentalism is driven by two
major forces that are crushing us like
jaws of steel. I t ’s been supported by
local regimes and by the new world
order dominated by “the We s t .” I t ’s
also been used everywhere to combat
the left and liberation movements. As
C h a r fi pointed out in his book I s l a m
and Fr e e d o m , Arab and Muslim
regimes didn’t just fund movements
but drew up education policies aimed at
teaching the fundamentalist view of
Islam.So the idea of a lasting confron-
tation has been planted in people’s
minds.
The younger generations are cut off
from universal ideas. Philosophy is no
longer taught in Muslim countries or
else in such a minor way as to have
little effect.The other major force dri-
ving fundamentalism has to do with
international politics and economic
relations between North and South.
Since rich countries support despotic
regimes, the mosque is the only place
where the local and world economic
order can be contested. Add to that
what are perceived as attacks from the
outside, such as massive Western sup-
port for Israel and the bombing of Iraq,
Srebrenica (Bosnia) and now Afghan-
i s t a n .The media also carry a heavy res-
ponsibility because they only talk about
Islam when there are attacks and pre-
tend not to know that fundamentalists
are a minority. All this is setting the
scene for a new Hundred Years’ War
and creating an extreme division bet-
ween Islam and the West.
So you agree with Samuel Huntington’s
ideas on the “clash of civilizations.”
No. Huntington depicted this clash
as something almost biological, as if we
were all fundamentally different,as if
culture was a kind of second nature. I n
fact, the clash is a historical construc-
t i o n , a product of specific conditions
and political choices.
So you don’t see Islam as hostile to
democracy and human rights…
D e m o c r a cy and human rights are
recent victories won by humanity. The
values that the fundamentalists and
Huntington say are Western are in fact
u n i v e r s a l . D e m o c r a cy is like fire or
Arabic numerals—the property of
humankind.Islam is neither for it nor
against it.A Muslim can only be against
it if he accepts the historical interpre-
tations of the Koran as “ u n c r e a t e d ”
and the s h a r i a —these fantasies that
came later and claimed religion must
rule everything. Of course,We s t e r n e r s
were the first to achieve democracy,
but they did so in special historical cir-
cumstances and they too had violent
arguments before doing away with part
of their religious heritage.
In Muslim countries, the critical
school of thought might have a chance
if there were minimal conditions of
freedom.Look at the recent history of
Iran. In the 1950s, the country was at
about the same stage of development as
Greece. If the CIA hadn’t overthrown
Mohammed Mossadegh in favour of
t h e S h a h , he would probably have
u s e dt h e c o u n t r y ’s oil to move towards
democracy.
But the Shah suppressed all dissent
and accepted U. S. d o m i n a t i o n . O n c e
a g a i n , Muslims were forced back to the
roots of their identity in Islam. Even
left-wing Iranians eventually supported
Khomeini as a way to fight the Shah’s
d i c t a t o r s h i p.Twenty years later, in 1997,
more than two-thirds of Iranian voters
put their weight behind Mohammed
K h a t a m i , a supporter of this critical
school of thought that I call “the new
conscience of Islam.” ■
