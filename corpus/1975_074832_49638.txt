On the following pages the "Unesco Courier" pre¬
sents passages from a unique and as yet unpublished
textbook of Eskimo culture. The chapter from which
the extracts are taken is an account of the Eskimo
way of life as related by the people of Payne Bay,
an Eskimo village of 250 inhabitants on Ungava Bay
in New Quebec (Canada). While compiling the book,
a Canadian specialist in Eskimo language and culture,
Michèle Therrien, spent many hours listening to the
village story tellers of Payne Bay recounting for the
benefit of their children the folk wisdom and skills
which have enabled the Eskimos to survive in a
harsh and inhospitable environment.
In the past, Eskimo children lived in close contact
with their parents, who were their sole teachers.
With the coming of modern civilization and a more
settled way of life, many Eskimo children now
attend residential schools and are thus separated
from the family and its traditional education. For
this reason, Eskimos have often asked that special
attention be given to the teaching of Eskimo culture
in schools.
It was in response to this wish that the School Board
of New Quebec asked Michèle Therrien to prepare
a textbook in which the Eskimos themselves would
share in setting down the basic features of their
culture. Madame Therrien is a lecturer at the Centre
of Arctic Studies and at the Institute of Oriental
Languages and Civilizations (both in Paris). The
textbook is to be published shortly in a trilingual
Eskimo, English, French edition by the School
Board of New Quebec (Quebec Ministry of Educa¬
tion, Canada).
The Eskimos use two sys¬
tems of writing, one sylla¬
bic, the other alphabetic.
The letters in syllabic writing
above are pronounced "Kan-
girsumiut" and mean "the
people of Payne Bay". Payne
Bay (whose Eskimo name is
Kangirsuk) isasmall villagein
the Canadian Far North
whose inhabitants helped to
produce the textbook of
Eskimo culture, extracts of
which are published here.

The way we lived
/ When we were young, our
homes were cold places. My
mother used to go off fishing
while I stayed behind. When
she was nearly home, I could
hear the noise she made cross¬
ing the snow and at last I
would see her emerging from
the darkness of the night.
We were very thankful when
she brought fish back with her
or when my father brought
back seal meat. When they
were away, I stayed by myself
in the cold house.
When I grew up, I went off
in search of moss for the fire.
I used to bring back great
quantities of it. This was how
it was until the time came to
move into the igloo.
The menfolk used to hunt the
walrus. When the hunting had
been good, they would bring
the sledge (qamuti) laden with
meat inside the igloo. The
meat used to be cut up imme¬
diately after the kill and soon
froze on the way back. Thus
we would have a supply of
good fresh food. We usually
ate it raw because the oil lamp
(qulliq) cooked things only very
slowly.
When we gave up the igloo
and moved back into our tent,
it felt warm and seemed very
light, and life was quiet and
peaceful.

How we travelled
Leaving the village, we used
to follow the Payne river
upstream. Accidents sometimes
happened. I remember Sarah
Attasi being pulled out of
the boat (umiak) by the rope
with which the dogs towed the
boat along the river bank. The
dogs were pulling the boat
near to the bank and Sarah
was helping them when the
rope got caught in the rocks
and pulled her in. My father
began shouting "She is dead".
The journeys were often very
difficult, especially when we
were passing upstream through
the rapids. The dogs would
pull the boat with long ropes,
a woman going ahead to guide
them. The men would look
after the boat. The passengers
were not allowed to move. The
men rowed and the man at the
tiller had to be very careful.
I recall another accident. The
boat was holed and the peo¬
ple in it were drowned. Two
of them, an old man and his
wife, were washed away and
the stream carried their bodies
right from the headwaters of
the Payne river back to the
village.

preparing
for the long winter
in days gone by
SHELTER: People used to live
in tents made of skin from the
springtime until late autumn.
After hunting and fishing, they
would return to Payne Bay in
autumn but would leave again
for their camp in the winter.
They would use their tents until
there was enough snow to
build an igloo, putting up a
wall of snow round them until
the snow was deep enough to
cut blocks out of it.
FOOD: After the summer hunt¬
ing and fishing, the food was
put in store. Seal meat was
placed in balloon-shaped bags
of sealskin (purtaq) from which
the fur had been removed.
These were left on the spot
and covered with rocks, and
when the men or the dogs
needed food in the winter
they would go out by dog-
sleigh to fetch it. It was
impossible to transport all the
fish and game taken during
the summer to the winter
camp as families travelled
from summer to winter quar¬
ters by boat (umiak). The food
consisted of dried and frozen
fish, walrus, whale and seal
meat. Shellfish were a fa¬
vourite food in summer.
FUEL: In addition to wood,
seal oil (ursuq) and various
mosses were used for lighting
the stove. They were stocked
up in the autumn, like food.
Brushwood was gathered be¬
fore the snow fell. Fuel was
needed every day for heating
and cooking.
TRANSPORT: The traditional
umiak of wood and skins was
replaced by a more modern
all-wooden boat. The umiak
was only used in summer and
a family rich enough to own
one would invite another family
to use it to return to winter
camp (it could carry about ten
people).
CLOTHING: Autumn was a
very busy season for the wom¬
enfolk,, who had to sew all
the winter clothes for their
husbands and children: mittens,
atigi (warm jacket), coats of
caribou or sealskin or eider¬
down-stuffed coats, sealskin
boots, trousers. All this sewing
was done in addition to the
usual daily chores of cooking.
collecting firewood and looking
after the children.
HOUSEHOLD EQUIPMENT:
This consisted of a soapstone
lamp (qulliq), lamp oil, rlintstone
(kasuk), dried moss, sufficient
sealskins to make the harness
for the dog-sleigh, a wooden
platform on which the bed was
placed in the houses and hunt¬
ing igloos, crockery and uten¬
sils.
TEMPERATURE: A sharp eye
should be kept on the weather
to see if it is suitable for hunt¬
ing, gathering fuel etc. Check
the weather very early in the
morning.
FISHING TACKLE, WEAPONS:
The hunter needs to have all
his equipment in good order
and ready for use. He makes
fishing-spears (kakivak) sledges
and a canoe (kayak), and
cleans his gun. He makes a
white screen out of a piece of
cotton or skin, stretched over
a wooden frame for seal-hunt¬
ing, to conceal him from his
prey. He gets his cartridges
ready. Before guns came into
use, hunters used to have to
make their bows and arrows
and harpoons. The hunter
always needs to carry a knife
and a bag with him.
SEAL HUNTING: The hunter
may be hunting the seal single-
handed on the ice. He climbs
a hill to see if there are seals
around. If there are, he sets
off with his dogs, taking with
him a youngster to hold off
Solitude, stone cut print, by Kalvak
22

the dogs while he tries to kill
the seal. After the kill, he
signals to the youngster to
bring up the sledge. If they
suspect there are other seals in
the neighbourhood, the young¬
ster will stay in the background
and try to calm the dogs.
FISHING IN WINTER: Fishing
Is done through the ice with
a hook and line. One can also
build a stone dam (saput); the
fish then group together and
can be speared with the
kakivak.
FISHING IN SUMMER: Nets
are used, and must be placed
in a certain way if the catch
is to be a good one. They
should not be stretched too
tight, they must be kept clear
of waterweeds and must not
be placed in deep water where
it is difficult to net fish.
TRAPPING: Both men and
women set traps. A good catch
depends on having a good
technique. The trap must be
covered over with soft moss,
not too thickly or the moss
will get caught while the fox
escapes. The scrap of meat
or rotten eggs that are put in
the trap should not be too big
or the fox will be able to bite
them without getting caught.
The direction of the wind is
important: If the trap is up¬
wind from the fox, it will be
attracted by the smell and go
straight towards the trap.
Young boys also set traps.
It is always a red-letter day
when a catch is made as the
proceeds of the sale can be
used to buy tools or hunting
weapons.
FAMINE: When food is short,
families count on one another's
help. Those who have a little
food share it with their neigh¬
bours. People still remember
particularly difficult years when
families broke up and went
their separate ways to avoid
running out of food.

How to build
an igloo in a storm
You need to know quite a lot
to build an igloo. We used to
build shelters for ourselyes
when we travelled with dogs
and we still build them even
now when we travel with snow¬
mobiles.
It's dangerous when the
snow is falling and the wind
blowing at the same time. The
igloo may be buried or you may
lose your way. You must stop
and think where to build and
you must choose the right spot,
otherwise the igloo may be
blown away or covered with
snow.
Nowadays we use fast snow¬
mobiles which can get. us back
to the village quickly, if all
goes well, but you have to
learn to take precautions just
in case.
You put a canvas screen
upwind from the igloo; if you
haven't got a screen, you can
use blocks of snow. Soft snow
is soon blown away and you
cannot build with it. It is diffi¬
cult to breathe inside the igloo
when there is no wind. You
should also be wary of freezing
snow. When it is very cold
and the igloo is on too high
ground, the snow can easily be
blown away.
If there is no good snow
about, you have to build an
igloo with whatever you can
find. The best snow for build¬
ing igloos is shiny, with crystal¬
lized snowflakes on its surface,
looking as if rain had fallen on
it. This is good snow; it looks
the same on top and under¬
neath. It is neither too soft nor
too hard.
There 'are no trees here and
you. must be very careful when
you go out hunting. If you are
going to be away for more than
a day, if you cannot get back
to the village and a storm is in
the offing, you must size up
the situation very carefully.
Every minute counts when
snow is falling, the northeast
wind is blowing and dark
clouds are building up.
If you are making an igloo
during a snowstorm and you
see the snow piling up around
the igloo, it is a danger signal,
especially if you have only just
started building. This has hap¬
pened to me twice. When the
fresh snow covers the igloo
you must abandon it and find
another place to build a shelter.
My brother used to go with
me and I was careful not to
let him out of my sight. I
used to call him so that we
did not get separated. If you
cannot make yourself heard, it
Is better to call the dogs since
they have very good hearing.
This was how I found where
I was when I called to my
dogs for help. It is a good
idea to carry some reserves
in case of a sudden storm.
You must also look after the
snowmobile. When we used
to have dog sleighs, we built
a platform with blocks of snow
and put the qamuti (sledge) on
it out of reach of the dogs,
which would otherwise eat the
harness. A snowmobile can
get buried under the snow, and
it is also very heavy to lift.
Before leaving the village,
make sure you have a knife
and a screen. Without these
implements, a hunter can freeze
to death or get frostbite in his
feet if his snowmobile breaks
down a long way from the
village.
When the Igloo is finished,
you still need to protect your¬
self. Just coming into the
igloo from the cold immediately
makes you feel warm, but if
you have no sleeping bag or
heater it starts to feel very
cold inside at night. When this
happens, you must keep mov¬
ing about. You should dig
a hole in the snow and put
your feet in the hole, keeping
your boots on to prevent frost¬
bite. You must also find
something to sit. on so that
your clothes do not get wet.
I was taught how to get
around and how to build a
shelter. I watched others do it
and I did it myself. You should
try to do things that are worth
doing. I say these things so
that the young people should
know about them. What I am
saying will help them when
they hear others talk about
these things or have to do
them themselves. They may
seem hard to believe at first,
but when you try them out,
you will find that they are
useful, particularly during our
coldest months, December,
January and February.

The state of the ice
in autumn
You should know that In the
old days, when the dogs were
crossing dangerous ice, it was
easy to turn around and go
back. In the daytime you could
tell by the dogs what state the
ice was in. Nowadays, the
snowmobile keeps straight on
and there Is no means of know¬
ing whether the ice is dan¬
gerous or not.
When you see small snow-
flakes on the surface of the
Ice it means that this is Ice
which has only just frozen and
which is not yet very solid.
So it Is dangerous. You some¬
times also see a sort of snow
mixed with water.
You should never walk on
new ice. Lakes sometimes
seem to be frozen hard, but
the ice may be very thin In
the middle. There is no dan¬
ger near the shores of the
lake: the water begins to
freeze around the edges and
the Ice gradually spreads
towards the middle of the lake.

Dangers of the ice
in springtime
There are several signs
which warn you that the spring
Ice is dangerous. These are
some of the signs you will
see on lakes and rivers. Be¬
ware of holes filled with
soft snow, which forms little
bubbles. Melting ice is also
dangerous. The ice sometimes
looks firm underneath a layer
of snow but the snow may
conceal a hole.
Lakes which are in the lee
of mountains often have holes
filled with soft snow.
When you want to walk on
a lake, it is best to keep at
first by the shore where the
snow is piled up. Ice and
snow float better where the
snow on the shore of the lake
is deep.
Zacharlssle Tarqlaplk
Building a kayak
It takes four weeks to build
a new kayak, including the time
needed for sewing the skins.
Four large seal skins are need¬
ed for a large kayak. The
finished boat is heavy and
two men are needed to carry
it down to the water. The
people of the interior used to
use a kayak made of wood
and caribou skin. It was light
enough to be carried by one
man.
Tumasl Kallak
Fishing
Put a piece of tunu (caribou
meat), fat or guts of fish on
the end of the line to attract
the fish. You can also use
a piece of white cotton.
The bait should not be attach¬
ed too firmly or the fish will
not bite.

Gathering shellfish
in winter
The fisherman makes a hole
in the ice and slips down
through iL At low tide, it is
possible to crawl along under
the ice. You take a lamp with
you and in this way you can
gather the shellfish from the
rocks. Sometimes there is no
need to make a hole, as the
cracks in the ice are big
enough for a man to pass
through.
This is a very dangerous
way of collecting shellfish.
Fishermen have sometimes
been unable to find the hole
where they came in and have
been caught under the thick
ice as the tide rose.

Hunting
Floating ice is sometimes
piled up by currents at the
mouth of the Payne river. One
must be very careful.
When you are going hunting
and you want someone to go
with you, never force anyone
to go. They may agree to it
without really wanting to. So
they may be lazy and careless
during the hunting expedition.
An accident can happen or you
can lose your boat if the per¬
son with you doesn't look after
it properly. This sort of thing
always causes trouble.
A woman can be very useful
if she is used to hunting. She
can do the things that a boy
would do in similar circums¬
tances and she will also learn
to hunt well in addition to
working at home.
When you kill a seal, you
must cut it up immediately and
put the pieces in the boat. If
you get caught in the ice, you
can then easily throw the
pieces overboad. It is also
better to stay within sight of
other boats. If you are in
danger you can easily call for
help.
If you see a seal lying on
the ice with its fur dry, it
means that it is asleep. If Its
fur is wet it Is not asleep and
can see you perfectly well, as
seals have sharp eyesight You
can try to catch it by making
lots of noise.
The mother seal is very dan¬
gerous. It loves and protects
its young. It will attack your
boat if you try to kill the young.
It has very sharp claws.
As they rise to the surface,
big seals make bubbles. Just
before a seal emerges, the ice
moves and you will see two
big bubbles. If you touch the
ice, it will know you are there.
The best thing is to hit it the
moment it appears.
The small seal, known as
tigituraq, Is easier to hunt.
Even if the boat makes a lot
of noise as it runs into the Ice,
these seals are not bothered.
You can try listening for big
seals by holding an oar pushed
through the ice. When you
hear the seal coming towards
the boat, you must circle round
and round the same point. The
seal will then surface for a
second.
Tiriluk seals are often found
on Ice floes around islands at
low tide.
You sometimes see seals on
the ice but you cannot get to
them because too many ice
floes are being carried along
by the current, but you some¬
times also see places which
are not dangerous.
If you find a place where
there ¡s a lot of ice or where
the ice floes are too near to
each other, you can easily pull
24

away from the shore; when we
used kayaks, it was more diffi¬
cult as the kayak was heavy
and had no motor.
Beware of freezing water.
In autumn sea water Is very
heavy, much heavier than fresh
water would be. When there
is snow on the surface, It looks
as if no snow has fallen. That
is the time to be very careful.
Also, you should not leave
your boat on the ice near the
water's edge, and especially
not at right angles to the sea.
The melting Ice may break and
the boat may slip into the
water. Put it in a safe place.
Ice breaks near the shore.
Before trying to walk on the
ice when you have seen a seal,
you must make sure that the
ice will not break. When there
is not much ice left round
about, what remains will be
brittle.
Take care of your canvas
screen. Do not rest your gun
near the frame. Fire over the
top of the screen because
some seals have very keen
eyesight and you may other¬
wise miss your chance to fire.
If you are walking towards
a seal and you see it move Its
head, you must stop If it starts
to move.
Seals raise their heads when
they are breathing in. They do
not breathe when they are lying
down, just as if they were in
the water.

Hunting the fox
When the hunter goes around
his traps in autumn, he some¬
times sees a fox outside the
trap. If the fox sees the hunter,
the hunter must pretend not
to have seen it so as not to
frighten it away.
If the fox does not see
the hunter coming, the hunter
should hide behind a rock and
whistle. The fox will think it
is a lemming and will come
closer.
If the fox is facing him, the
hunter must stop when the fox
stops, otherwise it will run
away. When a fox is near and
is not looking in the hunter's
direction, the hunter should fire
quickly before the fox sees
him. If you see a fox asleep,
rolled up in a ball, you can get
very close to it.
Saalatl Simionl
Hunting the hare
The hunter can follow the
tracks of hares on the hills.
If the hare is going round one
side of the hill, the hunter can
set off round the other side
and meet it.
If the hare hides among big
rocks to rest, it will stay there
until the hunter sees it When
the hunter approaches, it runs
away. The best thing to do is
to pretend not to see it and to
head off in another direction to
find a good angle from which
to shoot.
Never walk straight towards
a hare. By approaching from
the side, you can get very
close to it. It is possible to
follow the tracks of hare, but
they may go on for a very
long way. It is better to look
elsewhere.
Saalatl Simionl
Hunting the ptarmigan
Walk down wind. If you see
several birds together and they
fly off, you know that they will
settle again. Walk down and
fire. Some of them will fly
away and settle a little further
off. Keep following them down
wind and In this way you can
kill them all.
It is good for children to go
with their parents to hunt the
ptarmigan, but they must stay
well away and be careful.
When the birds hide, you can
follow their tracks.
Saalatl Slmloni
The diver bird
Old people believe that the
diver bird can tell them certain
things. When the diver is in
the water and moves its body
from side to side to show that
Its feet are pointing in a certain
direction, it is called nulurtutuq,
which means that it is holding
its feet above the water.
You must then look to see
if both its feet are raised: If
so the diver telling you that
it has seen caribou In a certain ,
direction.
The hunter knows that the
caribou are there but still a
long way away If the diver
does not dabble its feet in the
water when it moves them.
This means that the hunter will
reach the spot where the herd
of caribou is in two or three
days.
He sets off straight away and
when he arrives in the area
indicated, he immediately sees
tracks on the ground; he then
follows them in the direction
shown by the diver.
If the diver dabbles its feet
in the water as It moves, then
the hunter knows that the
caribou are nearer.
If you are soon going to
run out of food during the
summer time, the diver appears
to be very sad; it makes a
noise showing that it knows the
people are going to go hungry.
If you see a pair of divers
dancing on the water and
making a lot of noise, it means
you are going to be lucky and
have plenty to eat. They some¬
times even disturb the water
on a very calm lake and this
is an omen for the hunters.
Killing a caribou,

Joyfully, I see ten caribou,
print by Pootagok
25

When the diver flies In a
circle and looks as if It is going
to land, this means that there
are caribou nearby but you
cannot see them. If the hunter
has understood this signal from
the diver, he should go to a
nearby hill to spot the caribou.
These things are only of
use to those who know the
habits of the diver.
What I have said is true:
these things have really hap¬
pened.

Hunting expeditions,
yesterday and today
How shall I tell the story?
Perhaps I can tell you what I
know myself, by my own ex¬
perience, things that nobody
else has taught me.
I used to have dogs and a
sledge. I went out in all wea¬
thers. When there was a
snowstorm and I did not know
which way to go, my dogs
would help me. I would simply
give them their head. Left to
itself, a dog will find its own
way, but If the hunter tries to
direct it, the dog will probably
get lost in the snowstorm as
well.
Nowadays we use snow¬
mobiles and we have to be very
careful. There is nothing to
help the driver. I can easily
lose my way If I don't watch
out. I know that some paths
are dangerous. I would have
been very glad If someone else
had warned me about them. A
track leading out of the village
can sometimes become bad and
dangerous, especially in spring-
. time.
Unless I keep an eye on the
weather, I can run Into trouble.
You need plenty of petrol for
the return journey, especially if
it takes longer than the outward
journey.
It would have set my father's
and mother's minds at rest if
I had learned to move around
safely away from the village:
that is what the Inuit think.

Foot races
and bail games
Puvirnituq means stinking
rotten meat (during the hot
summer).
There were several women
who used to travel over the
ice. They used to build their
own igloo. There were also
groups of men who hunted.
They had a dog which used
to smell out the holes in the
ice. The hunters would stick
their harpoons in the hole in
the ice and pile blocks of snow
all around. Then they would
wait all night for the seal to
come up to breathe. Some¬
times they would fall asleep.
The men were so hungry that
they grabbed hunks of meat.
One of them cut his hand
without even feeling it. One
of the hunters who wanted to
keep all the pieces for himself
had nothing at all.
They fed their dogs on a kind
of soup made with seal meat.
One of the hunters was
responsible for warning the
others If the ice started to
break. If it did, they would
set off for the land. The jour¬
ney might take a whole day.
The igloo built on the ice
had a block of ice in place of
a window. This ice came from
a lake which was often far
away. Every time they moved
they took the window with
them but sometimes they forgot
it and they would have to go
back to fetch it.
When they returned to Puvir¬
nituq, the hunters used to
collect whale oil during the
summer. This used to be sent
off to the south. Some hunters
went away to hunt caribou
inland. Those who stayed to
work were taken on by the
whites and were paid a wage;
part of the money was given
to them in the morning and
the rest in the afternoon. A
whole day's wages were called
tatauti.
The various people of Unga-
va the Sirqinirmiut, the Nuna-
miut and the Sinaamiut used
to get together for games.
Some of these people lived on
the coast, some on the main¬
land, and some on the ice.
They used to organize compe¬
titions. Their clothes were
very prettily decorated.
Two of the women folk had
a reputation for embroidering
beautifully ornamented clothes.
They began to sell these to
the Europeans and learned two
words: yes and no.
There used to be foot races
and ball games. To decide
which of the teams should have
the first turn In the team
games, a circle was drawn and
a stake to which was attached
a loop of rope was driven into
the ground. The ball had to
be thrown as high into the air
as possible and had to pass
through the loop.
