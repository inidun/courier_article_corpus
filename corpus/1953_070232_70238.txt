A great historic event is taking
place in Israel today. This
is no less than the making of
a new nation out of human
and cultural material the an-
tecedents of which go back
thousands of years, and the
development, of this new na-
tion into a modern democratic
community. Last December, as
scientific adviser on behalf of
Unesco, I had the good fortune to
be able to visit this land, and see
with my own eyes the changes that
are taking place there.
There is one thing in Israel that
immediately strikes the observer
and especially the social scientist.
It is the remarkable process of a
people's renascence and transfor-
mation. This differs in several
respects from what"normally"has
happened in history. In Israel, it
is confined to a very tiny area and
is to an unusual degree a controlled
and planned operation moving
with extraordinary speeed. This
means that events in Israet are
taking place under experimental
laboratory conditions. And it
means, too, that the social scientist
can study here a variety of im-
portant problems, so to speak"in
a test-tube".
This fact alone is enough to
attract the social scientist to Israel
today. In my own case, I will
admit that there is another, less
academic motive as well. It is : \
belief in the idea that man's pro-
gress in a world of hate will be
helped not so much by peace
propaganda as by a determined
effort to understand what actually
goes on between different human
beings, different social and racial
groups, between different national-
ities-in other words, to un-
derstand why people hate each
other and then to discover and
apply the remedies. This approach
may be slow and strenuous, but it
is functional. It is Unesco's
approach today, and I believe it is
one which fits our time and the
future.
More than 700, 000 people, or
about half of the total Jewish
population of the country, are new
Israelis, having arrived within the
last four years. The job of housing
them and getting them settled
presents staggering problems that
have to be solved by the State and
local authorities. The sharp drop
in immigration during 1952 (down
to only about 10 per cent of the
average for 1948-1951) gave the
country a breathing spell during
which it was possible to get all but
a few thousand permanently hous-
ed and settled. About 20 per cent

of the people are today rural
settlers, and theJY are, for many
reasons, the heart of the new
nation. The farmlands provide
desperately needed food, and also
provide the kind of community
life for the settlers which is the best
school for nationhood.
The rurat settlements, and espe-
cially the kibbutzim are the natural
melting pots of Israel. It is there-
fore a matter of urgent national
policy to attract more people to
them, and to train the youth for
rural life and work. In this re-
gard, too, the experiments that are1........' : _--.... __ : .. 1--... 1. =-being carried out III
the Israel laboratory
offer exciting perspec-
tives.
The trend of urbani-
zation is universal and
one of the striking
features of all modern
societies. How can it
be reversed, especially
in a population made
up of newcomers
whose background for
centuries has been
mostly urban ? Israel
has come up with
part of the answer,
in its rural commu-
nities, but there still
is a long way to go.
Looking at Israel, I
found that this coun-
try offers almost un-
equalled opportunities
for the study of the
kinds of problems
we need to under-
stand in order to live
better with each other :
problems of human
relations, of cultural
and social adjustment,
of community integra-
tion, of co-operation in
a society where most
people are strangers
to each other. These
problems are of vital
importance to Israel
right now and will be
for a long time to
come. They are equal-
ly important to many
other countries indi-
vidually, and to our
world at large.
It was in recogni-
tion of this fact that.
Unesco decided to stu-
dy Israel and in parti-
cular the methods
that are used there to
reduce tensions and
conflicts that inevitab-
ly arise within a new
population composed
of so many different
elements. Nations do
learn from each other
sometines. What can
we learn from Israel ?
This study is now
underway. It is being
conducted with grants
from Unesco and
other sources by a
group of leading Is-
raeli social scientists
from the Hebrew Uni-
versity and the Israel
Institute of Applied
Social Research, both
in Jerusalem. I doubt
whether any country
outside the United Sta-
tes could have made
available a group*. t----Tr' r- ibetter qualified for this study.
Apart from the high professional
standards of these men there is the
fact that social research in Israel
has for years been particularly
alert to these problems, and has
devoted much work to them.
The great transformation taking
place in Israel involves, among
other things, a rapid change in the
, working tools and the methods of
production and management. With
one bold morn the clock was set
forward from the age of a pre-
dominantly underdeveloped eco-
nomy and technology to that of our
mid-twentieth century.
Technological revolutions on
this scale raise serious problems
wherever thev occur. In Israel the
problems are aggravated by the
fact that the population is so hetero-
geneous and to a large extent
composed of new arrivals from
countries which must be classified
as"underdeveloped"from the
technological point of view, how-
ever advanced they may be in
other ways. This means that
in addition to the learning and
adjustment process which any
people has to go through in
entering the machine age, a
number of special problems are
people ? These and similar prob-
lems are the subject of a pilot
study now being conducted for
Unesco by Professor A. Bonne of
the Hebrew University who
explains the project in the follow-
ing terms :
"The immigration into the State
of Israel during the last four and
a half years included a very
considerable proportion of Oriental
Jews who came from countries
which are either completely agrar-
ian or on the verge of industriali-
zation. They experience in Israel

brought with them from countries
such as Yemen. Another problem,
which is beyond the scope of the
Unesco study but a topic of much
discussion, centres around the pres-
ervation of the ancient skills in
weaving, silverwork, etc. as an
enduring cultural tradition withm
the new industrial society. There
are many encouraging signs that
the old arts and crafts will not be
lost in Israel.
One of the most frequent re-
marks, heard in Israel today is :
What kind of a nation are we
ultimately going to be when the
posed for the people of Israel.
How does a person fresh from an
Oriental village or a North African
ghetto acquire the working and
and living habits of an industrial
civilization ? How does he become
the operator of complicated ma-
chines and exacting techniques
about whose existence he previous-
ly had no idea ? And how does he
avoid losing his numan dignity and
becoming an unhappy slave of the
machine rather than its master ?
How, finally, can porkers from
so many different social and cultur-
al backgrounds learn to work
together and develop in the indus-
trial milieu the kind of community
which will make all of them one
forms of production, industrial de-
vices and modern labour relations.
The problem of adjustment of la-
bourers coming from a purely
rural environment has been fre-
quently dealt with as a vital issue
in the schemes for the development
of backward regions. So far no
systematic investigation was made
with regard to the experience in
Israel with such workers who have
found employment in workshops
and industrial plants. The Unesco
enquiry is intended to fill this gap."
One of the fascinating aspects of
this study will be concerned with
the adaptation to the industrial
process of ancient handicraft skills

present large-scale process of im-
migration and settling has come to
an end ? Or, how will the many
different people who have been
scattered for so long in so many
foreign lands and who have devel-
oped such widely differing cus-
toms be able to blend into one
people ? The answer, of course, IS
hidden in the future, and only a
future generation will know. This
is an accepted fact by the adult
generation of today. Theirs are
the problems of getting settled and
of adjusting themselves to the best

difficult and complicated condi-
tions. Theirs is not yet the Pro-
mised Land. But it will be if they
and especially the youth and the
children make it so.
As a social scientist with a
"Unesco bias"I was struck again
and again by the wonderful spirit
and the practical skill I witnessed
in the youth settlements, in the
children's villages and in the
youth training centres all over the
country.
In this field, too, Unesco takes
a good deal of interest and is
sponsoring another study which
is directed by Dr. S. N. Eisenstedt
vf the Hebrew University, all
immigrant youth. It is a vast
field which may yield important
results on the ways in which
young people are integrated into
a community, the conflicts which
have to he overcome in the pro-
cess, and the acute tensions which
) n such societies arise between the
older and younger generations.
Eighty percent of the popula-
tion today lives in towns and
other urban conglomerations.
What happens here ? These
thousands of people are living
close to each other physically.
But, largely strangers to each
other and lacking the close per-
sonal ties and the common tasks
that exist in the kibbutz commu-
nity, how are they living in terms
of human relations, of community
integration and co-operation ?
These are problems of tremen-
dous importance, I believe, not
only for the future of Israel, but
for national communities gener-
ally in which heterogeneous
urban populations must learn tn
live together peacefully and
successfully. These problems are
today being studied by sociolo-
gists in many countries, Israel
can profit a great deal from
these studies but here, too, Isreal
itself offers almost ideal labora-
tory conditions for study. Recently
Unesco undertook a small'"test
tube"study of these important
social problems in co-operation
with a pioneering enterprise just
being launched.
The new enterprise is the
Community Health Centre at Belh
Mazmil near Jerusalem, organiz-
ed under the auspices of the IIa-
dassah Medical Organization.
The Centre is established in a
brand new suburban settlement
of about 500 famijies. Beth Maz-
mil is, in fact, a miniature mod-
el of urban Israel and a cross-
section of the nation as a whole.
The Centre started its activities iu
the community by a comprehen-
sive survey of the entire copula-
tion, family by family, and indo-
idual by individual. The survey,
which is now nearing its comple-
tion, includes a sociological study
of the tensions between differ-
ent nationality groups, ten-
sions between new immigrants
and old-timers, and political
tensions. It is hoped that a
continuing observation of the
Community Centre by social'
scientists wit ! show how far this
new type of organization is
successful in reducing conflicts
within the settlement.
The Unesco projects in Israel
should be completed by the end
of the year. Of course this is
only a beginning and little more
can be done than scratching the
surface of the problems. It is
hoped, however, that others will
carry on the work and particu-
lady that the social scientists of
Israel will be encouraged to
continue the exploration of these
great human problems.
