- m-NDIAS renowned poet, Radindranath Tagore. once called on
his country to"welcome the world to its breast,"During
the heat and passions of World War II, his calm voice
assured mankind that the future would see a great"coming
together of nations", and the growth of creative understanding
among them.
Responding to the invitation, and inspired by the same confi-
dence, the Unesco Seminar on Rural Adult Education for Com-
munity Action was held in Tagore's country during November
and the early part of December.
At this"coming together of nations" (1) at Brindavan Gar-
dens, Mysore, nearly 70 educationists pooled their ideas, know-
ledge and experience during 4 1/2 weeks and produced recom-
mendations for an action programme which Unesco will coor-
dinate and send out to all its Member States.
In this space it is possible only to provide a brief outline of the
enormously detailed elements of
the programme ; and merely to
suggest the Iar_ reaching effect
which this programme can bring
about. The four main divisions
of the Seminar's report are
"Literacy","Health and Home
Life","Economic Aspects"and
"Social Life and Citizenship".
These words imply vast and in-
callculalble changes in the lives
of nearly half the inhabitants of
the earth-and a consequent
elevation in the standards of life
for all men and women.
Here, in brief, are some of the
main conclusions of the four
working groups into which the
Seminar was divided :
Practical Approach
to Lltcracfl
LITERACY teaching is anacquired skill and needs
teachers specially trained
for the job."Quick and easy"
techniques still used in many
countries have proved faulty and
shoUild not be employed, whatever
superficially impressive results
they may claim.
The methods, although adapted
to local conditions, should always
be built on modern scientific
principles. The most important of
these is to teach reading through
perception of whole thought
units, and not sylla. 1 :) : e-by-syUaible
or word-by-word. It is impera-
tive that the contents of the
teaching material should be use-
ful and meaningful to pupils ; the
ordinary juvenile ABCs are
nonsensical to adults and tend
to limit reading speed and make
learning to read appear useless.
These are some of the conclu-
sions arrived at by the working
group dealling with LITERACY.
The first task, after agreement
on teaching methods, is to train
instructors. This is urgent in
Asian countries where the adult
population Is still largely illite-
rate.
A midwife for every 5000 people ;
a health centre composed of a
public health nurse, one or two
midwives, a sanitary Inspector
and a social worker for every
10, 000 ; a health unit composed
of several centres and a dispen-
sary under a medical officer for
every 30, 000. These are the mini-
mum requirements for an ade-
quate health service according to
the study group on this basic
problem of HEALTH AND HOME
LIFE.

sights impressed on all the educa-
tionists at the Seminar a sense of
urgency and impatience to put their
action programme into enect.
This group also emphasized the
need for follow-up work in lite-
racy teaching, the most important
aspect of which Is preparation
and distribution of specially
designed reading material. The
readers'interest must be caught
and held by dealing with subjects
of immediate concern to them,
of practical importance to their
dally lives.
Distribution of the literature
can be accomplished by setting
up rural lib ries founded on
modern principles. Energy and
ingenu1ty must. be employed to

with the development of rural
adult education and the formu-
lating of policies affecting the
home-life of a nation. The at-
tention of governments which
feel he. sitant to initiate rural
adult education programmes on
a mass-scaile owing to lack at
workers, should be drawn to the
vast untapped resources that can
be found among university stu-
dents and patriotic and socially
minded adults.

THE group specializing in theECONOMIC ASPECTS ofrural adult education stres-
sed the fact that the tow stan-
dard of living in Asia is largely
due to under-employment of the
agricultural population.
The setting up 01 health
units was recommended
by the group dealing with
Health and Home Lile at
the Mysore Seminar. Thou-
sands of rural communities
still lack minimum requi-
rements. Others on a
"sell-help"basis have
provided basic necessities.

Literacy is not the same as Education. but rather a means of pening up
the fields of education and of culture. In Asia* in much the same way
as it was conserved throughout he centuries in Europe, a rich cultural
heritage has been handed down by artists, philosophers, scholars and
by men of religion. such as the Burmese Shan monk. shown in this photo.
One of the aims of the work done at Mysore is to open up this heritage
to the mass of the people.

ministration and its own budget.
This group formulated its re-
commendations after a detaited
study of home and health condi-
tions in Asian rural communities.
The problem of disease-breeding
dirt was the dominating one in
all the areas surveyed. Lack of
cleanliness in cooking, sleeping
and living quarters ; lack of per-
sonal cleanliness ; absence of suf-
ficient latrines and adequate
drainage are at aspects of the
same problem.
Woman's Hole in
Fight For Health
ALL these deficiencies can bealleviated through educa-
tion ; and the prevalence
of malaria, tuberculosis and
other diseases can thus be
reduced.
The need for preventive medi-
cine-at least as important as
curative medicine-was stressed.
Here, the rural community worker
can play an important part.
even if not speciality trained in
medicine. A minimum knowledge
of individual and public health
is part of the necessary equipment
of each village worker. The
position of the woman in the
family must be improved and
her work appreciated : she must
be made the centre of all efforts
for educating the family to
he2, lth : er ways of living.
Unesco was asked to make its
member states aware of the im-
portance of giving women more
adequate representation on inter-
national seminars, national
It considered the following as
appropriate means of creating
fuller employment :"A com-
prehensive survey by experts of
the rural communities'primary
needs ; establishment of rural or
cottage industries to meet these
needs in order of priority. In
the choice of such industries,
self-sufficiency of the village
should first be aimed at-in
general, no attempt should be
made to compete with large-scale
urban industries using mass-
production methods". To fur-
ther achieve self-sufficiency, sub-
sidiary occupations should be
found, especially those that
provide work during periods of
seasonal unemployment. Train-
ing centres are required to
teach the skills necessary for
economic production of good
quality-these should also be
community centres which can
also serve as rural marketing
agencies. Co-operative organiza-
tion is necessary for almost all
cottage and rural industries, from
financing to production and
marketing.
Unesco has been asked to
collect and distribute to its
member stales all available infor-
mation on cottage industries.
"The teacher should not be
like the merchant seeking goodly
pearls, but like the husbandman
who waiteth for the precious
fruit of the earth and hath long
patience of it". This is one of
the basic principles which the
group considered should govern
the approach to the economic
uplift of rural communities.
Begin where the people are and
with what they have ; teaching
should reach down to the level
of the poorest ; no deserving
person should be deprived of
educational benefits by reason of
poverty.
Detailed reports of village com-
munity life in fifteen, mainly
Asian, countries served as the
background to the work of the
group which dealt with SOCIAL
LIFE AND CITIZENSHIP. They
revealed certain, trends common
to almost all rural communities,
the most important of which is
the Isolation of the village. The
village as a world of its own is
undoubtedly a danger to the
development of modern Asian
countries.
This study-group drew up Ã '
seven-point curriculum for citi-
zenship traini, ng with these
headings : Personal dignity and
worth ; respect and consideration
for all human beings irrespective
of social and economic status
and political and religious affilia-
tions ; kinship with the commu-
nity and cooperation in commu-
nity activities ; interdependence
of the social, economic and cultu-
ral life of the country as a whole ;
concept of one-world and its
implications in terms of world
citizenship ; cultural and national
heritage and unity in diversity ;
political rights and duties.
It was stressed that a curricu-
lum does not consist only of
informational items to be taught,
but also activities and experien-
ces which give life and reality
to them. Citizenship itself is a
dynamic concept which expresses
itself in activities. The group
has therefore indicated suitaMe
activities and experiences toge-
ther with the information to be
imparted.
No Blind Belief
in Modern Method
MUCH time was spent on thestudy of media and me-
thods in citizenship train-
ing as outlined In the curriculum.
Among the old traditional media
considered were : festivals, fairs,
pilgrimages to temples and tombs,
ashrams, folklore folk dances and
dramas, sport. These media of
proved worth should not be dis-
carded In a blind belief In the
superiority of the modern mecha-
nistic media such as press, radio
and film. The new media can
play a vital part In rural commu-
nity education, but they must be
handled with care, knowledge
and skill.
Other recommendations were :
In areas where the population
Is not yet enfranchised, local
self-governing institutions shouldbe introduced ; every country
should encourage the establish-
ment of special agencies for the
training of personnel and for
production of literature and other
aids for civic and social training
in rural areas ; Unesco should
undertake the production of adult
education literature and visual
aids especially suited for Asian
conditions ; it should draw up
specimen programmes for the co-
ordinated and Intensive use of
mass media In the presentation
of themes pertaining to adult
and fundamental education ;
follow-up seminars on a regional
and national basis should be
organized.
