orests:
a breathing
space for
the planet
by France Bequette
Forests are the earth's most
complex and elaborate natural
ecosystems. They cover about 10
per cent of the planet's surface and
26 j>er cent of the continental sur¬
face area (excluding Greenland and
Antarctica). The globe's biggest pro¬
ducers of hiomass, they exercise
great influence on energy exchanges
between the atmosphere and the
ground, intercepting solar radiation,
acting as a windbreak, fixing carbon
dioxide and returning a great deal
of water vapour to the atmosphere
via évapotranspiration. They are
directly dependent on the climate
and also one of its main regulators.
THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
Some 300 million years ago forests
of tree ferns and giant horsetail cov¬
ered the earth. Traces of them can be
found in coal deposits. Then the
oceans submerged the continents.
When the water retreated about 260
million years ago, conifers appeared,
followed some 130 million years later
by broad-leaved trees.
In the Tertiary era, about 50 mil¬
lion years ago, the northern hemi¬
sphere had a mild climate that was
propitious for the development of

plant life and was brought to an end
hy the onset of an Ice age. The fate
of vegetation was strongly influenced
hy the location of mountain chains.
Europe's east-west mountain mas¬
sifs prevented the migration of
plants, and tropical and sub-tropi¬
cal species died from the cold. In
the Americas on the other hand the
mountains run on a north-south axis
and presented no such obstacle. East
Asia had no Ice age and a large num¬
ber of species survived there and
later successfully reacclimatized to
places where they had once pros-
pered. This explains why the parks
and gardens of Europe contain maid¬
enhair, magnolia, maple and cherry
trees imported from Asia.
There are four major types of
forest (boreal-conifer, temperate-
broad leaf, scrubland and rain for¬
est). Conifers are dominant in the
boreal forest, from Alaska to

Labrador and from Scandinavia to
Siberia and Kamchatka, interming¬
ling with birch, willow and aspen.
The dark foliage of pines contrasts
with the white trunks of birches,
and the grass between the trees is
splashed with the colours of a thou¬
sand flowers. In the temperate zone
of the Northern hemisphere it is
too hot in the Southern hemi¬
sphere the appearance of the for¬
est changes with the seasons. The
slender trunks of oaks, elms and
maples form lofty groves of trees
crowned with intertwining branches.
Their leaves change colour from
light to dark green, then to the golds
and reds of autumn before falling to
the ground. On stony or sandy soils in
regions with Mediterranean or Cali-
fornian climates grow leathery-
leaved trees like the olive, succulent
plants such as cactus and the dense
scrub known as garrigue, maquis and

chaparral. In tropical areas the lux¬
uriant forest demands an even heat
and plenty of rain throughout the
year. The trees reach for the sky in
search of sunlight, sometimes climb¬
ing to 50 or 60 metres amidst a tan¬
gle of lianas and epiphytes.
A CARBON RESERVOIR
We know more than we did about
the interactions between forest and
climate, but they still give rise to
debate among specialists. Gilbert
Aussenac of the French National
Institute of Agronomic Research
(INKA) believes that the forest is a
more effective sunlight trap than
any other plant formation. Heat
stocked in the morning is restored
to the atmosphere in the evening.
When it conies into contact with
humid air hovering above the for¬
est, it causes rainstorms.
In order to show that the rainfall
regime is strongly influenced by the
forest cover, scientists have made a
model of the total deforestation of
the 5-million-km Amazon basin. In
this hypothesis the temperature of
the air would rise by from Io to 3°C
because of the fall in évapotranspi¬
ration, which would also result in a 26
per cent decrease in rainfall!
Less well known, but vital for the
future of the earth's climate, is the
relationship between the forest and
the increase in atmosjiheric carbon
dioxide (CCL). The concentration of
CO¿ in the earth's atmosphere has
risen from 280 volumes per million
(vpm) at the beginning of the indus- Temperate
trial era to 360 volumes today. This deciduous forest
in Canada,
is a staggering increase when com¬
pared with the 80-vpm rise that
took place in the 200,000 preceding
years, as calculated from measure¬
ments made in niicrohubhles con¬
tained in polar ice. The ligure may
well double by the middle of the
next century.
Forests play a dual role in the
earth's carbon cycle by absorbing a
large amount of the C02 contained
in the atmosphere and also by emit¬
ting C02. The biosphere and the
atmosphere annually exchange enor¬
mous amounts of carbon. The annual
flow of atmospheric C02 fixed in
plants by photosynthesis amounts to
some 100 billion tons, but this is
almost entirely counterbalanced by a
reverse flow caused by the breathing
of plants and micro-organisms in the
soil such as bacteria and fungi, which

decompose ground litter and organic
matter. If, for the moment, forest
ecosystems are fairly good sponges
for absorbing the CO., which we pro¬
duce and which helps them to grow,
they will no longer be able to do so if
emissions continue to increase and
deforestation is not halted.
DEFORESTATION
According to the Food and Agricul¬
ture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO), which is carrying out
a Forest Resources Assessment Pro¬
gramme, forests covered some 3,454
million hectares world-wide in 1995,
somewhat more than half of which
were located in developing countries.
Retween 1990 and 1995 the world's
forests underwent an estimated net
loss of 56.3 million hectares, com¬
prising a loss of 65.1 million hectares
in developing countries partly offset
by an increase of 8.8 million hectares
in the industrialized countries. For¬
est loss was not, however, as great as
predicted and has decreased overall.
Some communities have no
choice but to contribute to defor¬
estation. In dryland and upland areas
exposed to erosion, for example,
needy communities chop down the
sparse trees to provide fuel, food
and a meagre source of income.
Other contributory factors are over¬
grazing, extensive farming and fire
the scourge of dry forests of the
£ Mediterranean variety.

economic development programmes
in Latin America and Asia are lead¬
ing to a considerable decrease of for¬
est cover in these regions. Again
according to the FAO, demographic
growth is expected to force certain
parts of the world such as sub-Saha-
ran Africa and Latin America to
transform forest into farmland.
There is no guarantee that such a
conversion will benefit the popula¬
tions in question. B
