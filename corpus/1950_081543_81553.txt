SCIENCE impinges on. society in
two main ways : techno-
logically. by changing the
material conditions of life.
work and production ; and intel-
lectually, by changing the way in
which men think. The former is
the more striking, since at least in
the more advanced countries every-
body is in minute-to-minute
contact with things that have
arisen from scientific research.
Clearly a high standard of living
is dependent on the use of devices
produced by scientific technology
or the use of more traditional
articles, now produced more chea-
ply and abundantly by science.
Many of the problems that face
the world today can be solved only
with the aid of science. The
problem of world food shortage-a
doubling of output is required to


give everybody a sufficiency-can
be greatly alleviated and eventually
solved by the proper application of
science.
The application of science does
not merely solve a few problems ;
its cumulative effect changes the
. shape of social life, as can be seen
by considering the consequence of
the development of electrical

science-the redistribution of in-
dustry, released by electric power
from its former compulsory proxi-
mity to coal mine or wharf ; the
levelling up of amenities between
town and country ; the changes in
world communications resulting
from telegraph, telephone and
radio (and the international poli-
tical consequences of this) ; and
many others. Some of the social
effects create serious new problems
- the threat of atomic war, tech-
nological unemployment, or the
dislocation of traditional family
life that has been produced by the
car, the cinema, and the like.
U The Idea Of Progress"
THE intellectual social effects ofscience are less obvious but no
less real. The"idea of pro-
gress"-the idea that the world
can be progressively improved if
men act appropriately-is taken
for granted today. Before the 17th
century, it was virtually unknown.
And Bury (1920) has shown that
the origin and growth of this idea
is largely attributable to the
impact of scientific discovery on
men's thoughts and the attitude of
mind adopted by scientists. In
many other ways the spread of the
spirit of science can change-
usually for the better-man's
outlook on life.
It may well be that ultimately
the intellectual impact of science
will be far more important to
humanity than its contribution to
material welfare. But"man must
eat before he can think", and in
the present state of the world it is
not practical politics to envisage
the spreading of the scientific
attitude to mankind as a whole. A
necessary prelude is to feed the
starving millions, and even in the
advanced countries to provide
those greatly improved conditions
of life and leisure which, as history
shows, are the necessary basis for
scientific thinking.
It is therefore natural-that
discussion about the social impact
and social function of science
concentrates mostly on the ma-
terial and technological aspects.
This need not damage the intellec-
tual progress of science, since even
from the most material point of
view fundamental research pays
the largest dividends.
Six Basic Questions
IN a conscious approach to theproblems raised by the social
impact of science, the basic
types of questions to be answered
are :
(1)-What are the more important
problems of material welfare
today ?
(2)-What lines of research are
most likely to contribute to their
solution ?
(3)-A discovery or invention
seldom has only the effects that
were intended. Hence the more
general question that must be
answered before taking decisions
based on (2) : What are the
probable total social effects of a
given scientific discovery or of a
proposed line of investigation ?
(4)-What changes in the organi-
zation of scientific effort are
required in order that the inves-
tigations suggested by (2) and
(3) may be efficiently pursued
and the results quickly applied ?
(5)-As a basis for answering (4),
what is the present organization
and how efficient is it ? And
more generally, what factors,
social or individual, ultimately
decide the course of scientific
advance ?
(6)-What changes in general
social organization are made
advisable by the advance of
science ?
The bibliography in Impact
gives a survey of the main attempts
to answer these questions in recent
times. It makes no attempt at
completeness. A number of his-
torical works are included because
it is clear that the answering of
questions (3) and (5), and to a
lesser extent the others, can be
greatly helped by historical studies.
