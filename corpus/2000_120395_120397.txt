The traveller to Venice should arri ve
at the end of a summer’s aftern o o n
to see the sun turn into a huge red
disk and swell until it casts the lagoon’s
f u rthest islands in a fie ry glow before sin-
king into the sea.T h e n , when the last tou-
rist has left Saint Mark’s Square,Ve n i c e
once again becomes magi c a l . In streets
t h at are empty at last, the inhabitants of
the wo r l d ’s most beautiful city open their
d o o rs , letting the few lingering visitors
c atch a glimpse of a time-wo rn , h i s t o ry -
laden monumental staircase, or a hidden,
tree-shaded garden where Giacomo Casa-
n ova may have awaited one of his mis-
tresses two and a half centuries ago. It is
the moment when the souvenir shop signs
go dark and the Ve n e t i a n s ’w i n d ows light

Confronting the sea
with picks and shovels
Will Venice gr ow old and die like its
inhabitants? T h at is any b o d y ’s guess: t h e
t ruth is hard to come by in this labyri n-
thine city.Venice is the city of “ p e r h a p s ,”
as unstable as the lagoon’s ecologi c a l
b a l a n c e . It is impossible to imagine the
city without its lagoon, an uncert a i n
s p a c e , neither land nor sea, whose ve ry
name expresses absence: l a c u n a is Lat i n
for “ l a c k .” This precarious and prov i-
sional place emerged little by little as the
ri ve rs , t o rrents and streams that flow
across the plains on their way to the
A d ri atic deposited millions of cubic
metres of silt.
The lagoon is not part of the sea; it is
s e p a r ated from the A d ri atic by 50 kilo-
metres of sandbars that end with the
mouths of the Lido, Malamocco and
C h i o g gia port s. E ve ry six hours , the tides
run through the bars , flowing in as salt
water and receding as bri ny wat e r. Like a
gigantic lung made up of thousands of
bronchial tubes, the lagoon breat h e s. It is
not only formed by islands high enough to
stand up to the sea’s equinox tides.B a r e n e,
the sandbars that emerge at low tide, a r e
complex ecosystems, home to plants and
animals which have adapted to this
e nvironment oscillating between air and
wat e r.Ve l m e are the mud-flats visible at low
tide while g h e b i are channels that are
green with mire and seaweed through
which the water leaves the lagoon at low
t i d e .
The lagoon was bound to disappear
u n t i l , one day, a group of bold men
decided to make something solid out of an
unstable mass.T h e n , from one generat i o n
the next, the Venetians battled the ele-
ments like funambulists walking a tight-
r o p e . Prepared with shovels and picks to
confront the sea’s efforts to upset the
d e l i c ate equilibri u m , they had only one
thing in mind: to preserve the existence
and richness of Ve n i c e , the city of stone
and marble that they built on spongy
m a rs h l a n d , as if it were on t e rra firm a.
Venice was a utopia: the wo r l d ’s most
f r a gile city, but powerful enough to rule a
fa r - flung empire.
Those stubborn people started by
d rying out the land, d i g ging canals and
d e v i ating ri ve rs. For example, as part of a
huge project begun in 1501 and com-
pleted two centuries lat e r , they changed
the course of the lagoon’s three main
wat e r way s : the Sile, the Piere and the
B r e n t a . T h e n , and with increasing
f r e q u e n cy, they launched major public
and pri vate building projects to furt h e r
t h e civil and military development of
t h e “most serene republic.” These pro-
j e c t s enabled merchant vessels and
wa rships boasting the biggest drafts of
their time to enter the harbour or the
A rs e n a l .
“Although with each project the tech-
nology became  more aggr e s s i ve than the
simple shovels and picks of the early day s ,
these interventions have always gi ven the
lagoon enough time to develop a new
b a l a n c e ,” s ays Stefano Boat o, professor of
city planning at the Unive rsity of Ve n i c e .
The same was true during the operat i o n s
c a rried out in the second half of the 19th
c e n t u ry, when Venice was defin i t i vely inte-
gr ated into the Kingdom of Italy (1866)
after changing hands several times bet-
ween France and A u s t ri a .
It was not until much lat e r , b e t we e n
1952 and 1969, t h at the city was dealt its
h a rshest blow. A straight, 15-metre deep
canal was dug so that oil tankers could
b e rth at the industrial port of Marghera.
At the same time, highly polluting che-
mical and petrochemical plants were bu i l t
across the lagoon, pumping more and
more water out of the aquifers and pou-
ring more and more poison into the wat e r.
“At that time, the delicate balance that
had always existed, and that Ve n e t i a n s
had always managed to maintain ove r 1 9
c e n t u ries of interacting with nat u r e , wa s
b r o k e n . The situation is becoming alar-
m i n g,” s ays Boat o.
Aquatic highways for
tankers and tourists
The lagoon, a unique ecosystem
f o rmed of fresh wat e r , b rine and salt
wat e r , is inexorably turning into an arm of
the sea in its central portion and a swa m p
around the edges. D u ring the time of the
r e p u b l i c, it was forbidden to dig canals
more than four metres deep. To d ay, t h e r e
are ve ritable aquatic highways ove r
2 0 metres deep. Oil tankers , f r e i g h t e rs
and powerful speedboats that can carry
hundreds of tourists create waves that
d e s t r oy the sandbars and mud-flat s , a n d
cancel out the natural movements that
once slowed down the advancement of
the tides.
All these disruptions increase the
erosion that is ruining the depths of the
lagoon and eating away at the founda-

tions of bu i l d i n g s. The Venezia Nuova
C o n s o rt i u m , a group of public and pri vat e
companies which the Italian Public Wo r k s
M i n i s t ry and Ve n i c e ’s Water Depart m e n t
h ave put in charge of carrying out pre-
s e rvation work in the lagoon, s ays that
1 . 2 million cubic metres of soil are wa s h e d
away each ye a r , while the province of
Venice puts the figure at four million.
The mussel fis h e rmen who “ wo r k ” t h e

bute to the erosion.
To make mat t e rs wo rs e , fishing zones
s u rrounded by dikes limit the tides’ a r e a

of pumping subterranean water lowe r e d
the city’s ground level by 10 centimetres.
L a s t l y, the A d ri atic is ri s i n g, wo rsening the
floods to which the city and the surr o u n-
ding area fall victim.
As a result, in 1990 Venice was 23
centimetres lower than in 1908. F u rt h e r-
m o r e , b e t ween 1965 and 1995, the Ve n e-
tians “ f o r g o t ” to clean the city’s canals, a
practice that their ancestors considered
indispensable for reasons both physical (to
i m p r ove the circulation of tidewater) and
hy gienic (to wash out accumulated wa s t e ) .
The neglect has proven costly. On the
one hand,Venice is beleaguered by over 50
d ays a year of acqua alta (“high wat e r ” ) ,
which floods many of the streets and
s q u a r e s. On the other, with increasing
f r e q u e n cy the tides are so low that ve s s e l s
can no longer sail on the canals.
Hard work for
meagre results
On November 4, 1 9 6 6 , a gi g a n t i c
acqua alta entirely submerged Venice and
the lagoon’s islands for 24 hours , c a u-
sing tremendous damage to the city’s eco-
n o my and art wo r k s , and sending a wave
of panic around the wo r l d . If the wat e r
had risen a little higher, the wo r l d ’s most
beautiful city might have been lost. A n d
the flooding could reoccur at any time!
The shock triggered countless initiat i ve s :
Italian and intern ational commissions
were set up, studies conducted, l aw s
passed and projects proposed. M a j o r
i n t e rn ational bodies went on the alert ,
UN E S C O chief among them. The organi-
z ation moved its office for science and
technology in Europe to Venice and
u n d e rtook the grandiose “Project Ve n i c e ,”
an initiat i ve that has gi ven rise to a pro-
fusion of studies and meetings to pore
over all the problems of the city and its
l a g o o n : geology and morp h o l o g y, t h e
wat e r ’s dynamics, chemical and biolo-
gical processes, c o n t a m i n at i o n , d e m o-
gr a p h i c s , traffic and cleaning up the
c a n a l s.
No other city in the world has been
studied in such detail. None has been so
painstakingly dissected to determine the
reasons for its rise and fa l l .A n d , it must
be added, n e ver has so much hard wo r k
produced such meagre results.
All things considered, and at the ri s k
of ove rs i m p l i f y i n g, this complicated bu s i-
ness can be summed up in two sentences.
They are written in bu r e a u c r atic jargon in
l aw 798, the most important piece of
l e gi s l ation concerning Venice passed since
the 1966 flo o d . The first sentence say s
t h at the work to save Venice must “ r e s t o r e
the hy d r o g e o l o gical equilibrium of the
l a g o o n ,s l ow down and reve rse the process
of degr a d ation and eliminate its causes.”
In other wo r d s , e ve rything must be
done to clean up the canals and to restore
their depth to acceptable levels (other
l aws specify 12 metres), to re-open the
fishing lagoons, and to recreate the sand-
b a rs and mud-flat s. But a harm l e s s - s o u n-
ding sentence in the same law specifie s
t h at all these operations must be carri e d
out while “ p r e s e rving the area’s produc-
t i ve and economic interests.”
In other wo r d s , the bottoms of the
canals must be raised but oil tankers must
not be prevented from travelling through
t h e m , the size of the lagoon’s harbours
must be reduced but the current level of
t r a f fic must be maintained, the tidal swe l l s
must be contained but vessels must be
a l l owed to continue carrying swa rms of
t o u rists to the islands of Torcello and
M u r a n o. The law ’s authors seem to be
the direct heirs to the play w right Carlo
Goldoni and his Harlequin who serve d
t wo masters.
The system of mobile dikes and flo o d-
g ates planned as a solution has been a
bone of contention for nearly 20 ye a rs ,
setting off many debates and discussions
b e t ween engi n e e rs and politicians. It is
called MO S E, the Italian name for Moses
and an acronym that stands for M o d u l o
S p e rimentale Elettromeccanico, a prototype
flo o d g ate that was tested in the Tr e p o rt i
canal between 1988 and 1992. After ye a rs
of studies and numerous va ri at i o n s ,P r o-
ject Moses was adopted by the Ve n e z i a
N u ova Consort i u m .The plan is to equip
the entrances of the Lido, C h i o g gia and
Malamocco ports with a system of mobile
flo o d g at e s : chests that are 20 metres wide,
20 to 30 metres high and four to five
metres deep.
In normal conditions and as long as
the tide’s amplitude does not exceed one
m e t r e , the wat e r - filled chests will lie on the
floor of the canal.When the tide is dubbed
“ e x c e p t i o n a l ” (an average of seven a ye a r
and 20 in 1996), a hydraulic system will
fill the chests with air to raise them. S i n c e
the chests are connected to the canal’s
floor with stakes dri ven into the mud,
The city’s delicate equilibrium was upset by the digging of a canal deep enough to allow oil tankers to berth
at the industrial port of Marghera.
No other city in the world
h a s been studied in such
d e tail. None has been so
p a i n s takingly dissected
t o determine the reasons
f o r its rise and fall.

they work by rising like a gate that closes,
becoming dikes that cut the lagoon off
from the sea. Under the plan, 18 flo o d-
g ates will be set up at the entrance to
t h e p o rt of Chioggi a , 20 at Malamocco
and two sets of 20 and 21 separated by
a n i n t e rm e d i ate harbour basin at the
entrance to the Lido.
Furor over floodgates
According to estimat e s , this enorm o u s
task will require eight ye a rs , 6,000 wo r k e rs
and 3,700 billion lire (approx i m at e l y
$ 1 . 8 b i l l i o n ) .The city of Venice puts the
p r o j e c t ’s total cost at 5,334 billion lire
(in 1992 pri c e s ) , or some $2.6 billion—
not including maintenance.
“These mobile dikes must be bu i l t ,”
a f firms Philippe Bourdeau, a professor
at Bru s s e l s ’ Free Unive rsity and chairm a n
of the intern ational committee of expert s
named by the Italian gove rnment to eva-
l u ate the project. “The mobile flood-
g at e s ,” he say s ,“ a r e , along with raising the
ground level and the other planned mea-
s u r e s , the best way to save Venice for the
next 100 ye a rs.”
“These mobile dikes must be abso-
lutely avo i d e d ,” replies Stefano Boat o,
along with the Green Pa rt y, the Italia
Nostra environmental gr o u p, G r e e n-
p e a c e , the World Wildlife Fund for
N ature (WWF) and other env i r o n m e n t a l
o r g a n i z at i o n s , which say that the pro-
ject would have a disastrous effect on
the fragile ecosystem. But the munici-
pality of Ve n i c e , together with the Env i-
ronment and Cultural Heritage minis-
t ri e s , are leading the camp of those
i nvoking the precautionary pri n c i p l e .
They argue that the lagoon’s geomor-
p h o l o gi c a l , hydraulic and biologi c a l
balance must be restored—for example,
by cleaning up the canals, which began
in 1998 (see box ) , and raising the gr o u n d
l e vel—before any decisions about the
mobile dikes are made.
In addition to this controve rs y, o t h e r
questions have ari s e n . For example, t h e
c i t y ’s autonomy is at stake. The Depart-
ment of Wat e r , which depends on the
Public Works Ministry in Rome, and the
companies that make up the Consort i u m ,
which include major public and pri vat e
c o rp o r ations (such as Fiat ) ,h ave few or no
ties with Ve n i c e , whose population has
been accustomed to solving its problems
alone for 2,000 ye a rs.
Fear of
oil spills
And then there is the economic aspect:
$2.6 billion, a sum that rises with each
passing day, is a tremendous amount of
m o n e y. If all of it is allocated to a single
p r o j e c t , w h at will be left for other initia-
t i ves and for the small Venetian companies
t h at could carry them out? When all is
s a i d and done, the big corp o r ations in
M i l a n , Tu rin and Rome would reap the
b e n e fits and Venice would have to settle
for the cru m b s.
The debate has been raging for a long
t i m e . In November 1998, the project’s
e nvironmental impact commission,
appointed by the Environment Ministry
and chaired by Maria Rosa V i t t a d i n i , a n
architecture professor at the Unive rsity of
Ve n i c e , issued a negat i ve assessment and
requested the Consortium to review the
entire project. One month lat e r , a minis-
t e rial commission published a similar
r e v i e w, which was annulled in June 2000
by the regional administrat i ve tri bunal of
the Ve n e t o.The latest news is that ,d u ri n g
a meeting of experts held in Rome in July
2 0 0 0 , P rime Minister Giuliano A m at o
said the final decision would lie with his
office and that it would be made at a
cabinet meeting by the end of the ye a r.
But what if Ve n i c e ’s real problems is
not the exceptional tide, such as the one
t h at struck the city in 1966? And what if
the next disaster comes not from the
lagoon but from the sea? Each ye a r ,
2 5 million tons of freight is shipped on the
l a g o o n , half of which is oil and petro-
leum products. A single oil tanker accident
would be enough to cause incalculable
damage to the ecosystem, c over the canals
with a thick coat of petroleum and leave
gr e a s y, viscous streaks on the founda-
tions of palaces and churches foreve r. O n
N ovember 29, 1 9 9 5 , five tons of light fuel
spilled into the lagoon, f o rming a huge
slick that drifted for four day s.Was that a
wa rn i n g ?
In the city of masks, the fie ry glow of
the beautiful red sunsets over the city’s
palaces and churches, which enchant tou-
rists the year round, m ay not be solely
the gift of nat u r e .T h at extra shade of red
m ay well come from air pollution ari s i n g
from Marghera’s petrochemical fa c i l i t i e s.

At exceptionally high tide, a hydraulic system fills
the chests with air. They lift and turn into gates
that cut the lagoon off from the sea.
