one thing you can say about water 
0. Argentina at the moment is that 
ere is too much of it. 
The endless, flat pampas stretching away from 
Buenos Aires are covered by vast shallow lakes 
caused by heavy rainfall, compounded by the lack 
of drainage systems to carry the excess water to 
the rivers. Even where the floods have drained, the 
water table has risen to within a few centimetres of 
the surface. 
Although international agencies advanced money 
to deal with the recurrent flooding, much of the

pampas have been under water for years. Only the 
  
money has dried up. 
Then the north-central province of Santa Fe was 
hit earlier this year by some of the worst flooding 
in centuries, with heavy loss of life and material 
damage. Water scientists blamed lack of planning, 
lethargy and corruption at the provincial level for 
compounding the affliction of nature. Finally, there

are the foul-smelling floods that invade the low-lying 
districts surrounding Buenos Aires, where rains 
inundate basements and septic tanks, and drinking 
water is often unfit for human consumption. 
Julio Arrieta, a film-maker and writer, has written 
a sketch in which space aliens colonize the earth. 
The invasion goes well until the invaders reach 
Buenos Aires, where the inhabitants of the Barracas 
district offer them a refreshing drink of water. The 
invaders die, as do the reinforcements sent to find 
them. Earth is saved. 
It is no wonder that the privatization of water 
services in Argentina has been controversial. When 
Carlos Menem, the former president, took office in

1989, he received a country in 
economic shambles. Raging 
hyperinflation reached five 
thousand percent a year and 
the entire public services 
and utility network was near 
breakdown. In 1993, Menem 
privatized the Buenos Aires 
water utility under pressure 
from the World Bank, the 
International Monetary Fund 
and the United States. 
The government granted a 
  
30-year concession to Aguas 
Argentinas, a consortium 
led by Lyonnaise des Eaux 
(later Vivendi, and now 
Veolia Environment), to run 
17 districts in the capital. 
The consortium received the 
concession for nothing, but 
promised to reduce water 
rates and expand services. 
The same group also runs the 
water services in Santa Fe. 
Water was one of the last of the utilities to be sold 
off to private concession and, despite the allegations 
of corruption, the call for tenders for water is still 
regarded as reasonably managed. The World Bank 
promoted Argentine water privatization as a model 
for the rest of the world. 
Aguas Argentinas set up a billing system that 
reached most users for the first time, and provided 
water to an additional two million people, although 
it was slower to install sewers. Now economic 
crisis has halted further expansion plans for the 
foreseeable future. 
The consortium dropped water rates on taking 
over the concession, but has repeatedly raised them 
since. And the business has been highly profitable. 
Under the original concession, the peso was pegged 
one to one to the US dollar. But it now takes more 
than three pesos to buy a dollar, and the privatized 
services all want to increase their charges again. The 
new president, Nestor Kirchner, is resisting as many 
Argentines struggle to survive in the grim post- 
collapse economy. 
The companies say they do not have enough 
income for anything more than paying wages and 
keeping up basic investment, while the public 
accuses Aguas Argentinas of falling down on water 
treatment and environmental conservation. 
Meanwhile, Marfa Julia Alsogaray, who had been 
appointed to lead an environmental cleanup in the 
rivers flowing into and around Buenos Aires, and 
who awarded Aguas Argentinas numerous rate 
increases, is currently on trial on charges of illicit 
enrichment while in public office. 
But the problems in Buenos Aires pale in 
comparison with those in other parts of the country. 
What is referred to as a “scandalous contract” 
involved the province of Buenos Aires and Azurix de 
Buenos Aires, an Enron subsidiary. Azurix offered 
over $300 million for the concession, $100 million 
more than any of its rivals, but failed so badly to 
provide an adequate service to major centres such 
as Bahia Blanca that the provincial government took 
over the operation. 
As in Cochabamba, in neighbouring Bolivia, 
residents of Argentina’s smallest province, Tucumadn, 
rebelled at the takeover of their water utility by a 
foreign company and the massive rate increases that 
followed. The French-owned Aguas del Aconquija 
pulled out of the deal after customers stopped 
paying their bills, leaving the utility facing an 
international dispute procedure and an uncertain 
future. 
While these disputes have been going on, the 
government has been meeting with fellow members 
of the Mercosur economic alliance - Uruguay, 
Paraguay and Brazil - to conserve one of the world’s 
largest aquifers — an enormous reservoir that covers 
an area equal to the size of France, Spain and 
Portugal combined, and is said to contain enough 
water to supply the needs of the entire world for 
200 years.
