TEN YEARS
OF PROGRESS
(Continued)
KILLING DISEASES
THAT ARE DYING
The phenomenal decline in mortality is the
most significant demographic event of the
last decade, according to the United
Nations Demographic Yearbook.. In the
world as a whole, death rates for 1950-1954
(latest available) were lower than those for
1945-1949, and countries with the highest death rates in
the earlier period (Africa and Asia) experienced the
greatest reduction.
The decline may be attributed in the main to advances
in environmental sanitation and disease control, and it
is reflected in increased life expectancy almost everywhere.
In the more developed countries a new-born girl can be
expected to live 4-5 years longer now than 10 years ago,
a new-born boy 3-4 years longer; and in some of the
countries undergoing rapid development, life expectancy
at birth has increased up to 11 years for girls and 10
years for boys.
With a decreasing rate of death and an almost
unchanged birth rate the population of the world (now
about 2,700,000,000) is growing rapidly: every hour almost
5,000 persons are added, or 120,000 _per day, or 43,000,000
per year an increase calculated to double the world's
population by the end of the century.
Pestilences that stalk no more
The last ten years have seen a dramatic decline in the
extent and severity of the pestilential diseases whose
names terrified our grandfathers cholera, typhus,
smallpox, plague, relapsing fever and yellow fever.
Cholera, for example, has dwindled in importance to
the point of being a problem only in its epidemic foci in
India and Pakistan, and even there a significant improve¬
ment has taken place: from 1945 to 1949 a total of 824,000
deaths were reported, from 1950 to 1954 less than 385,000.
Epidemic typhus is now disappearing from Europe and
North America and declining in the other continents.
Smallpox is claiming fewer and fewer victims; from 1945
to 1949 a total of 193,000 cases were reported in the whole
world compared to 178,000 from 1950 to 1954. Yellow fever
shows a decline of about 50% betwen 1950 and 1955.
Infections down, accidents up
While deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases are
only half of what they were ten years ago, accidents have
become a serious and often leading cause of death,
particularly among children and adolescents.
In North America and parts of Europe, accidents
account for nearly one-half of all deaths among boys
between 5 and 9 years of age. Road accidents claim
most young lives; then come falls, which in some countries
are responsible for up to one-third of all accidental
deaths, then drowning, fire and explosions and poisoning.
Both are doing well
Fewer and fewer women die in childbirth and more
and more babies survive their first step into this world.
In some countries, a 90% decrease in maternal mortality
6
has taken place during the last 20 years. In 1955, the
maternal death rate, as calculated per 1,000 live births,
was lowest in New Zealand: 0.4; 20 years ago it was 3.8.
The decrease is most spectacular in the countries under¬
going rapid development, for example Ceylon where the
drop was from 20.5 in 1936-1938 to 4.1 in 1955.
As regards infant mortality, the lowest rate in the world
is recorded in Sweden, where it dropped from 22 per
thousand live births in 1951 to 17 in 1956.
Malariaa monster in retreat
At least three-fourths of mankind live in malaria zones.
Up to 1948, about 300 million people were attacked by
malaria each year and 3 million died. During ten years
of malaria campaigns, these figures have been cut by 30%
but the disease still presents a huge international health
problem.
However, with the insecticides and drugs that are now
available, malaria eradication is possible almost
throughout the world, provided that campaigns are
pushed hard enough before insect-resistance to spraying
develops.
Some regions are close to the goal: in Southern Europe,
4,000,000 new cases a year were reported before the in¬
troduction of DDT spraying now less than 10,000 a year.
In the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics there were some
4,330,000 cases of malaria immediately after World War II.
In 1956 fewer than 13,000 new cases were found and no
new infections are expected to occur after 1960. In the
Americas, malaria once menaced 135,000,000 people. To
date 105,000,000 have been protected and the vigorous
campaigns now going on are expected to complete the
protection within a few years. In Africa south of the
Sahara, malaria presents the most serious and difficult
problem with which the specialists are confronted. Never¬
theless, at the end of 1955, 14,000,000 of the 116,000,000
Africans living in malarial regions had been protected
against the disease.
Even in the Eastern Mediterranean countries, tradition¬
al reservoir of malaria, striking results have been achiev¬
ed during ten years of antimalaria work; before, 40,000,000
people suffered regular attacks of the disease, now less
than 14,000,000.
These are the modern killers
Heart disease and cancer are not only the largest causes
of death in the majority of highly developed countries,
but they are on the increase.
In England and Wales, for example, deaths due to
cancer in 1947 accounted for 15.1% of all deaths. By
1955, the percentage had risen to 17.6. In Denmark the
increase was from 16.2 in 1947 to 21.8 in 1955, and in the
United States of America from 4.7 to 15.7.
In most of the highly developed countries, deaths from
cancer of the . respiratory system represent a growing
percentage of all deaths due to cancers.
Also deaths from degenerative disease of the heart and
arteries (the most frequent cause of death in North
America and most of Europe) are increasing. Among the
possible causes is the aging of the population and

consequent swelling in tne 40-80 age-group in which these
diseases are most prevalent. Also, diagnostic techniques
have improved, decreasing the number of deaths formerly
attributed to "senility" or to "unknown causes."
New defences against polio
The discovery in 1949 of a method of growing
poliomyelitis virus in tissue cultures revolutionized the
study of polio and eventually resulted in large-scale
vaccination campaigns with the killed-virus vaccine of the
Salk-type.
In the United States of America, for example, 70 million
people had been vaccinated by the end of 1956. That
year, the number of polio cases reported was the lowest
since 1947: 15,400 compared to 57,879 in 1952 which was a
record year for poliomyelitis. However, it has not been
possible to attribute the low incidence in 1956 entirely to
the vaccine. In 1957, Who recommended large-scale trials
with a new live-virus vaccine which can be given orally,
instead of being injected.
Tuberculosisa turning point
Tuberculosis is killing relatively fewer people each year.
For example, between 1950 and 1955 death rates per
100,000 population dropped from 58.1 to 31.1 in France;
from 13.8 to 6.3 in Denmark; and from 143.6 to 63.0 in
Portugal. Nevertheless, tuberculosis is still the greatest
killer of all infectious and parasitic diseases, and in North
America, Europe and Australia, it accounts for three-
fourths of all deaths from these diseases occurring after
the age of 15.
A considerable change in the age distribution of deaths
from tuberculosis of the respiratory system has taken
place: before World War II the majority of victims were
women between 20 and 30 years of age and men between
40 and 55. Now, deaths are most numerous among people
over 60, women and men alike.
In 1955, a turning point was reached in the world
outlook on tuberculosis with the advent of new drugs
promising a revolution in the management of the disease.
Pilot studies are being sponsored by Who to determine
whether the new drugs can effectively be used in large-
scale home treatment of tuberculosis victims.
History's greatest vaccination campaign
In history's greatest campaign of immunization, 192 mil¬
lion people have been tested, and 74 million vaccinated
against tuberculosis with BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin)
between 1948 and 1957. The work was started in war-
torn Europe by Scandinavian relief organizations and later
expanded to the other continents with the aid of Who and
Unicef. Since 1951 the campaign has been supported by
these two international bodies in close co-operation with
the governments concerned. By far the largest part of
the programme, both with regard to the number of coun¬
tries and the number of persons involved, has been carried
out in Asia.
Pneumonia steady at new low
A substantial decrease in the number of deaths from
pneumonia has taken place since penicillin and other
antibiotics became available.
Most lives have been saved in New Zealand, Switzerland,
Italy, the Netherlands, the United States and Sweden,
where the decrease in pneumonia deaths ranges from
62.1% to 53.1%. Next come Norway, Denmark, Canada,
Finland, Austria, Scotland, Ireland, Germany and Japan,
The Unesco Courier. May 1958
with a drop of 43% to 32.6%. The figures for South
Africa, Northern Ireland, England and Wales, and Portu¬
gal have gone down from 26.2% to 14.1%.
Nevertheless, pneumonia still ranks among the 10
diseases causing the greatest number of deaths in the
more developed countries. It remains one of the three
leading causes of death among infants, and is even more
serious among the aged. Little variation in the death
rate for pneumonia is at present being reported from one
year to the next, and it can be assumed that it will remain
at the present level for some years to come.
Fewer beds, yet more patients
Mental patients occupy between 40 and 50% of all the
hospital beds in Europe and North America. There are
not enough beds for thousands more who might benefit
from hospitalization. How can this pressure be eased?
New mental treatment techniques now being applied in
several countries may provide one answer. Ten years ago
in Ville-Evrard, France, for example, the average stay of
patients before discharge was over one year; now it is
four months. This hospital which in 1948 had 550 beds
and admitted 100 new patients a year, now has only 270
beds but gives care to 600 new patients a year and the
percentage of patients that must be kept indefinitely has
gone down from 50% to 7%.
Diphtheria capitulates
A prevalent disease at the beginning of the twentieth
century, diphtheria is now in full regression throughout
the world, particularly in Europe which was the continent
most seriously affected. In a number of countries, among
them the United Kingdom and Denmark, diphtheria has
to all intents and purposes disappeared through vaccina¬
tion campaigns.
In 1948, 119,000 cases were reported from the whole of
Europe. Now the annual number of cases is less than
half that and in 28 countries in Asia, America and Europe,
the number of deaths from the disease dropped from 5,148
in 1950 to 2,824 in 1955.
Whooping cough still strikes
Although still the most deadly of infectious diseases for
children, whooping cough is on the retreat. In 28
countries all over the world, deaths from this disease
dropped from 26,325 in 1950 to 10,376 in 1955. The highest
death rate is among children less than one year old but
it is in this age-group also that the decrease is most
striking: from 7,874 in 1950 to 1,623 in 1955. Whooping
cough is unique among the diseases of childhoood as it
usually strikes and kills more girls than boys.
Who is getting medical care
There are now 1,236,000 physicians serving the world's
2,700,000,000 inhabitants and the 638 medical schools
operating in 85 countries graduate annually about 67,000
new doctors.
There are 14 countries fortunate enough to have one
doctor to serve every thousand or fewer people. But there
are 22 others where there is only one doctor for 20,000 or
more inhabitants. Between these two extremes, the rest
of the world shows great variations.
As a general rule, there is a shortage in rural areas,
while cities have been known to have an over-abundance
of medical practitioners.
While nine countries have one medical school for less
than one million of population, there are 13 countries with
only one such school for 9 to 17 million people.
