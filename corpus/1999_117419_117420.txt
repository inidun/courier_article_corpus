Berlin was once an island. I move d
from Cologne to West Berlin in 1988,
when the Wall was still standing. To
reach the city you had to travel through
the German Democratic Republic (GDR),
a country that the average West Germ a n
b o rn after the war knew less about than
France,Spain or Belgium.
Reaching West Berlin was like dri v i n g
through a tunnel.The city was  already the
largest in the Federal Republic, but so ve ry
distinct from it.This melting pot of “ c o l d -
war wa rri o rs ” , ageing activists of the 1968
r e vo l t s , politically active students and disillu-
sioned artists made a somewhat archaic
impression on the outsider.The highly-sub-
sidized showcase of the We s t e rn wo r l d ,We s t
Berlin had a pa rticularly leisurely existence.

Gone are the days of We s t
Berlin’s insular tra n q u i l l i ty and
East Berlin’s state-coerced ca l m .

BERL IN: BIRT H
A ND REBIRT H
By European standards, Berlin is a relatively young
c i ty, with its first records dating from 1234. Lo ca t e d
at the crossroads of a medieval trading route, the city
rapidly prospered and became the residence of the
p owerful Hohenzollern dynasty that reigned for over
500 years. The sprawling capital, which Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder referred to as the “Berlin Republic”
upon taking up office there on August 23, stretches
over 800 sq. km and is located 80 km from the Po l i s h
b o r d e r. The move of the century took place over the
summer, with the transfer of parliament, ministries
and 12,000 employees from Bonn (involving no less
than 120,000 pieces of furniture, 38,000 metres of fil e s ,
carried for the most part by rail, with special road
convoys for confidential defence files and art works).
Powerful symbols of the past remain: the fin a n c e
m i n i s t ry will move into the building from which Luft-
waffe chief Herman Goering commanded the air
war, while the Ministry of Labour will be housed in the
former headquarters of Nazi propaganda chief Joseph
G o e b b e l s .

Stadium, lasting from 10 a.m. until 2 the next morning. The meal costs around 10 Deutschmarks ($5).

Reclaiming its former status marks a rebirth for
Berlin, a city at the heart of the German enlighten-
ment in the 18th century when it was capital of the
kingdom of Prussia, before being proclaimed ca p i t a l
of the German Empire in 1871. During the 19 20 s ,
Berlin was one of Europe’s foremost cultural and
s c i e n t i fic centres, associated with such names as
Bertolt Brecht, Walter Gropius and Albert Einstein. But
the 19 20s were also marked by rising unemployment
and merciless inflation, facilitating Hitler’s rise to
p ow e r. In 1945, the devastated city was divided into
four zones of occupation, then partitioned into East
and West Berlin in 1949. The wall was built in August
19 61. When the city celebrated its 750th anniver-
s a ry in 19 87 on separate sides, few could have pre-
dicted that the country—and Berlin—would be reu-
n i fied two years later. In 19 91, the Bundestag chose
Berlin as capital by a narrow 18-vote majority. The city
is now one of superlatives, with three opera houses,
160 museums and an ultra-modern cinema complex
that will be ready for the next Berlin Film Festival in
Fe b r u a ry 2000. The capital is placing hope in its
n ew status to shore up its economy and become a
major transportation hub, with Europe’s largest
railway station under construction. n

Bird’s eye view
of a burgeoning city
It was only by heading east in the city
t h at you started to feel uneasy—the contrast
c o u l d n ’t have been gr e at e r. After passing
the rigorous border checks and changi n g
the obligat o ry amount of curr e n cy, you step-
ped through the Iron Curt a i n — yet suppo-
sedly you were still in the same city.T h e
people all seemed so similar, with closed
expressions on their fa c e s.The pubs we r e
usually empty and you had the impression,
especially after 11 at night when the theat r e s
c l o s e d ,t h at the capital of the GDR had rol-
led up its sidewalks—but  as it turned out,
this was only on the surface.
So much for the past.I t ’s now been almost
ten ye a rs since the Wall was pulled dow n .G e r-
m a ny is reunited and so is Berlin, which is
n ow the country ’s capital with the Bundestag
(parliament) and gove rnment having move d
from Bonn this summer. I t ’s been seven ye a rs
since I moved to the Mitte District on the bor-
der of Prenzlauer Berg in East Berlin.At firs t ,
c u riosity drew me here, the wish to discove r
this “ o t h e r ” city inside my ow n .We were lucky
enough to get hold of  a wasteland whose
ow n e rs had not been clearly identifie d .Yo u n g
people transformed empty halls, fa c t o ries and
ballrooms into art associat i o n s ,t h e atre wo r k-
shops and “ i n ”p u b s. As these new ve n u e s
became more established, the arts scene shif-
ted from West to East. Just a casual stroll will
lead you to marvel at an arr ay of conve rt e d
buildings and spaces that I doubt you wo u l d
find in any other city.
Right in the centre, just about 500 metres
n o rth of the Reichstag, t e e n a g e rs have car-
ted sand up to the demolished We l t j u g e n d
( “ World Youth”) stadium on Chaussestrasse
and set up a “beach vo l l e y b a l l ”p i t c h .R i g h t

next to the pitch—remember this is bang slap
in the city centre, s u rrounded by office blocks
and shopping malls—there’s a huge golf trai-
ning course for sports students and other
a m at e u rs.These initiat i ves aren’t motivat e d
by profit but by the simple desire to play vo l-
leyball or golf right dow n t ow n . But has
a nyone on the city council considered that
this area is going to be one of the most inve s t-
m e n t - at t r a c t i ve construction sites in the city
once the gove rn m e n t , the Bundestag and
their administrations have moved in?
Potsdamer Plat z , about 500 metres south
of the Reichstag, tells a completely different
s t o ry. Just after reunificat i o n , the Berlin
Senate thoughtlessly sold it off to Daimler
Benz and Sony. In the last few ye a rs , t h e
a r e a , which was the largest construction site
in Europe, has turned into an art i ficial com-
mercial district with new residential streets.
There used to be an insular tranquillity in
West Berlin, while a state-coerced calm pre-
vailed over East Berlin.To d ay both have fa l-
len between the cracks of the contrasting
d e velopments of volley ball courts and com-
mercial zones.
B e t ween these two areas, there is one
place from which one can pause to contem-
p l ate Berlin: the new terrace and dome of
the renovated Reichstag building provide a
b i r d ’s - e ye view, from a good distance, of this
city in full transform at i o n . If you look
t owards the west across the city centre’s
large park, the T i e r g a rt e n , little seems to
h ave changed. Early into a summer’s eve ,
you can see curls of smoke rising from
countless Berlin barbecues, most often
b e l o n ging to large Turkish families making
up for the absence of a  garden. A midday
stroll through the garden reveals another
Berlin peculiari t y : naked sunbat h e rs ri g h t
in the city centre!
N ow look east to find the view domina-
ted by a forest of cranes in action. Old bu i l-
Hard-hatted tourists take a guided visit to the Sony company’s building site on Potsdamer Platz, whose
concentration of cranes and construction works symbolizes the new Berlin.
The Oberbaumbrücke, Berlin’s longest bridge, frames a boat-load of tourists on the river Spree. A terminus
for road traffic and an underground railway line before reunification, it was reopened in 1994.
If you look towards the west
across the city centre’s large
park, the Tiergarten, little
seems to have changed…
Now look east to find the view
dominated by a forest of
c ranes in action. Old buildings
dating from the GDR era which
are not protected as historica l
monuments are being
demolished to make way for
n ew construction.

dings dating from the GDR era which are
not protected as historical monuments —
from hotels built in the 1960s to the Fo r e i g n
O f fice—are being demolished to make way
for new constru c t i o n .The redistri bution of
f o rmer GDR propert i e s , which usually hap-
pens by selling off land and buildings to pri-
vate inve s t o rs , has provoked a ve ritable reno-
vation hy s t e ri a .You can only guess at the
façades of homes hidden behind the scaf-
folding lining nearly eve ry street in East Ber-
l i n .Where I live , houses are being renova-
ted one after the other, the facades painted
in pastel hues, with balconies added, a p a rt-
ments built into the roofs—and steadily
rising rents.
G i ven all the buzz and activity of the
c o n s t ru c t i o n , you look forward to an eve-
n i n g ’s refuge in one of the “ a l t e rn at i ve ”
e n c l aves I mentioned earlier.“ A c u d ” , for ins-
t a n c e , has such a special feel.The bu i l d i n g,
which used to house squat t e rs , is set back
from a busy street in the Mitte Distri c t ,j u s t
around the corner from my place.Acud is a
world of its ow n .B a n n e rs draping the seve r a l
s t o ries of the building announce a smorgas-
bord of cultural eve n t s. In the at t i c, you can
sit back in old car seats and discarded row s
of cinema seats to enjoy films rarely scree-
ned elsewhere. One floor down you will fin d
a small gallery, b e n e ath that a concert hall
and an A f rican restaurant.The court yard has
been taken over by fringe theatre gr o u p s
w h o ’ ve created a performance space with an
i m p r ovised nature reminiscent of the “ G l o b e
T h e at r e ” . Daily life unwinds in places like
A c u d ,which reflects the events and the meta-
m o rphosis of the New City.These are islands
in a sprawling city which only ten ye a rs ago
was an island itself. n
