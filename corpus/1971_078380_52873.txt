25 YEARS
OF UNESCO
PUBLICATIONS
ON ART
OlNCE It came Into being 25 years ago, Unesco has published a large
number of books on art, either directly or in collaboration with publishers
in different countries. Unesco's large-format art albums, paperbacks
with colour reproductions of great masterpieces, sets of colour slides,
catalogues of high-quality reproductions of paintings, indexes, specializ¬
ed studies and popular books on art have helped to make the world's
artistic and cultural treasures better known to the general public.
In the following bibliography we have been able to list only Unesco's
major publications on art. Some of these publications are now out of
print, but it has not been possible to Indicate this in every case.
Wherever available current prices are given.
