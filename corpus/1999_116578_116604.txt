The member states of the Nort h
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
decided on March 24, 1999 to start the
m a s s i ve bombing of Yu g o s l avia on the
grounds that they were defending Kosova r
p o p u l ations of Albanian ori gin in the name
of the unive rsal values of the intern at i o n a l
c o m m u n i t y. Olivier Corten believes that
classic intern ational law, which would have
required a prior resolution by the UN
S e c u rity Council, was ignored on the
grounds that it was outmoded: a double ve t o
by Russia and China would have been a
f o rmal obstacle that was inappropri ate in
such an emergency.

Making Kosovo a milestone in the
gr owth of a right of humanitari a n
i n t e rvention may turn out to be ve ry
e m b a rrassing for its support e rs. It is virt u a l l y
impossible to say that , at the end of the day,
the intervention will have improved the
h u m a n i t a rian situat i o n .The deport at i o n s
and atrocities the Kosova rs of A l b a n i a n
o ri gin have been subjected to are not a
direct result of interve n t i o n , but that is
i rr e l e vant because the consequences of
intervention were not only foreseeable but
were predicted by many foreign observers.
And this is the dilemma. Either the
We s t e rn planners have good intentions bu t
h ave carried them out incompetently,
thereby losing all credibility as guarantors
of respect for the law, or else they are
c o m p e t e n t , but their motives are perhaps
less humanitarian than they publicly
proclaim.The second of these possibilities
clearly seems to be more likely.W h at ’s more,
N ATO ’s passivity in equally seri o u s
s i t u ations elsewhere (Angola, A f g h a n i s t a n ,
S i e rra Leone, R wa n d a , Kurdistan) makes
it even harder to defend the thesis of
“humanitarian”intervention.
This may be why many states refused to
s u p p o rt it. The Islamic world has widely
condemned the deport ations and at r o c i t i e s
but has not taken a clear stand on the
l e gi t i m a cy of military interve n t i o n .The Rio
G r o u p, which includes nearly all the Lat i n
A m e rican countri e s , has condemned the
d e p o rt at i o n s , atrocities and military
i n t e rve n t i o n , and has called for the United
N ations Charter to be respected. M o s t
member countries of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS, which embraces
most of the former Soviet republics) adopted
the same position.
I n d i a ’s representat i ve on the United
N ations Security Council said on March 24
t h at “no country,group of countries or regi o n a l
a rrangement can arr o g ate to itself the right to
take arbitrary and unilateral military action

THE FIRST LESSONS OF KO S OVO

against others. . . . we have been told that the
attacks are meant to prevent violations of
human ri g h t s. E ven if that were to be so, i t
does not justify unprovoked military
a g gr e s s i o n . . . .W h at is disturbing is that both
i n t e rn ational law and the authority of the
S e c u rity Council are being flouted by
c o u n t ries that claim to be champions of the
rule of law. . . .The Nonaligned Move m e n t
[has] repeatedly said that the United Nat i o n s
cannot be forced to abdicate its role in
p e a c e k e e p i n g .”
Opponents of the intervention also
include countries as dive rse as Namibia,
South A f ri c a ,L i b ya , Gabon and Iraq. So to
claim that NATO ’s action reflects the will
of the “ i n t e rn ational community” as a whole
has ideological ove rt o n e s. In fa c t , m a ny
c o u n t ries fear that this kind of precedent
will legitimize a new role for NATO as a
“ world policeman” and open the way to
s e l e c t i ve actions to serve the interests and
meet the concerns of powerful countri e s.
The attitude of NATO member stat e s ,
which say that the Intern ational Court of
Justice at The Hague is not competent to
hear the complaint lodged with it by
Yugoslavia,only confirms this fear.
In these circumstances,advocating the
right of intervention risks being associated
with a return to the gunboat diplomacy
which the authors of the United Nat i o n s
C h a rt e r , especially the Latin A m e ri c a n s ,s e t
out to eliminate.

The intervention in Kosovo both is and is
not a question of the right of humanitari a n
i n t e rve n t i o n .To begin with,nobody disputes
that the Serbian regime is guilty of serious
human rights violations on its own soil, i n
K o s ovo. This is grounds for legal
i n t e rve n t i o n , and the recent indictment of
f i ve of its leaders by the Intern at i o n a l
C riminal Tri bunal for the Fo rmer Yu g o s l av i a
resoundingly confirms that.
The nature of the intervention has also
been tacitly accepted by the intern at i o n a l
c o m m u n i t y.The Security Council refused
on March 26, by 12 votes out of 15, t o
condemn the air at t a c k s. And on A p ril 16,
the UN Human Rights Commission, by 44
votes out of 51, condemned “ e t h n i c
c l e a n s i n g ” , while the opponents of this
c o n d e m n ation had stressed that it would be
tantamount to justific ation of the bombing.
These two votes provided an implicit legal
basis for the bombing. F i n a l l y, t h e
i n t e rvention was not unilat e r a l , as in a
classic colonial operat i o n , but multilat e r a l .
H owe ver the purpose of exercising the
right of humanitarian intervention is to help
the victims. F i rst by staying the hand of the
executioner. But not only have the victims
not been protected but the executioner has
gr own tougher: the announced aim of the
i n t e rvention and the result achieved by it
are poles apart . S e c o n d , by providing free
access to the victims so they can be helped.
H owe ve r , no humanitarian organization has
been able to set foot in either Serbia or
K o s ovo.T h i r d , free access is still without
the necessary support of an accompany i n g
a rmed force, in this case, i n t e rvention on
the ground.
The Kosovo precedent has adva n c e d
the cause of the right to intervene because of
the indictment, for the first time, of a sitting
head of stat e . It has also made people awa r e
t h at the right to intervene on humanitari a n
grounds is necessary, but it has shown that
in the field, the present half-measures are
giving a flawe d , e ven false view of its
a p p l i c at i o n . In short , the right has become
more popular, but the exercise of it to help
the victims has run into political obstacles.
