South Africa: puppets in prison

"Why use puppets to educate prisoners about
Aids ? The puppet is a visual metaphor, repre¬
senting 'real life' and at the same time one step
removed from the real world. Puppets can be
highly controversial and thus often 'say more'
than live actors. Especially when tackling taboo
subjects like sex and death, they can be less
embarrassing to the audience. Puppetry can be
used to break down racial and social barriers,
and can reach all audiences, including the illit¬
erate. Combining them with humour and
music is entertaining, holds up a mirror to

society and enables people to look and
laugh at themselves."
In 1987 Gary Friedman and Nyanga Tshabalala
founded Puppets Against Aids, a non-gov¬
ernmental organization that raises awareness of
the disease. In 1996 they held a six-week pilot



workshop, Puppets in Prison, with a group
of young prisoners in Diepkopf prison in
Johannesburg (South Africa). Participants
developed performances whose scenarios
included rape, sexual practices, drugs, human
rights, prostitution and the correct use of con¬
doms. A documentary video about the project
was made and televised in several countries. This
creative, informative experience had a con¬
structive effect on inmates. Photos on these
pages were taken by Gisèle Wulfsohn at Diep¬
kopf during the workshop.
