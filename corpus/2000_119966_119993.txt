The 20 countries 
where women hold at least 
25% of parliamentary seats
Women in national parliaments
(in percentage, by region,
both houses combined)
Nearly eve ry w h e r e , with the notable exception of
c o u n t ries like Ku wa i t , l aws entitle women to
vote and be elected. But in reality, the propor-
tion of women in legi s l at i ve bodies falls far short of
representing their percentage in the general popula-
t i o n .The Inter-Pa r l i a m e n t a ry Union (IPU),a Geneva -
based organization comprising 139 parliaments, s ay s
t h at men still account for 86 per cent of the wo r l d ’s par-
l i a m e n t a rians and that no country—not even in nor-
t h e rn Europe—has achieved total pari t y. In the form e r
communist countri e s ,which once boasted some of the
wo r l d ’s highest rates of female representation in poli-
t i c s , the percentages have fallen sharply since 1989.
L i k e w i s e , the IPU say s , “there has been no signi-
ficant increase in the number of women heads of
g ove rnment and, a b ove all,m i n i s t e rs throughout the
wo r l d .” The average number of women heads of
g ove rnment is around 12 per cent.A n d , they seldom
obtain strat e gic portfolios such as fin a n c e , the interi o r
or defence but are more likely to be gi ven the minis-
t ries of social affa i rs , the fa m i l y, health and the env i-
r o n m e n t ,which have lower funding and less political
c l o u t . ■
