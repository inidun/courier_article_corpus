I he roofs, cupolas and other ar¬
chitectural features of medieval
Russian churches are so rich in sym¬
bolism that even from afar believers
could identify the spiritual idea to
which each church was dedicated.
The early chronicles tell us that the
oldest Russian churches had more
than five cupolas. The cathedral of
St. Sophia in Novgorod, built in oak
in 989, had thirteen, and the stone
church of the Dormition of Our Lady,
built in Kiev at the turn of the
eleventh century, is reported to have
had twenty-five.
The number of cupolas was always
significant. Six stood for the unity of
the Church Militant and the Church
Triumphant in prayer. Five embodied
the Redeemer and the four Evan¬
gelists, addressing sermons to the
four parts of the world. Seven cupo¬
las stood for the mystical number
seven, which evoked a wealth of
associations including the seven gifts
of the Holy Ghost and the seven days
of Genesis.
Thirteen cupolas denoted Christ,
the embodiment of Heavenly Wis¬
dom, and His twelve disciples, while
the figure twenty-five stems from the
Apocalyptic presentation of the Holy
Trinity through the vision of God on
His throne surrounded with twenty-
four seats on which twenty-four elders
are sittingthe disciples and the
prophets.
The renowned ensemble of monu¬
ments on the island of Kizhi on Lake
Onega in the north of European Rus¬
sia has two multi-cupola'ed churches
and a one-cupola belltower. The total
number of cupolas, thirty-three, sym¬
bolizes the years of the earthly life
of Jesus Christ.
Tent-shaped roofs
The tent-shaped roof has also been
a widespread feature of Russian
church architecture since the early
Middle Ages. Most tent roofs were
eight-sided, representing, with their
cupola, the mystical number nine.
When you look at such a roof from
the ground, you usually see the sides
of three triangles again represent¬
ing the number nine. The roof rising
above the centre of the octahedron
symbolizes God, the centre of the
universe, and is crowned with a
cross, the symbol of Christ. The tent-
roofed churches of the Dormition at
Varzuga on the Kola Peninsula and
Kondopoga in Karelia are particularly
majestic examples of this style. The
roofs symbolize Our Lady enthroned
in Heaven and joining Her Son.
Another architectural feature, the
use of tiers or storeys, became
widespread in the latter half of the
seventeenth century. Cubes, octa¬
gons and other volumes were ar¬
ranged in a series of superimposed
storeys, gradually tapering towards
the top to produce an impression of
vertical heavenward movement. The
tiers, or storeys, stood for the unity
of the Church Militant and the Church
Triumphant, with the heavenly struc¬
ture ascending to the throne of the
Creator. The gradual tapering effect
reflected the diminishing number of
souls acquiring greater degrees of
sainthness. As Jesus said, "Many are
called, but few are chosen." Churches
with elongated storeys which taper
only gradually were known as pillar
churches. Storeyed and pillar

churches embodied the Christian
symbol of Jacob's Ladder, the stages
of the spiritual struggle to moral per¬
fection described in The Ladder of
Divine Ascent by the sixth-century
monk St. John Climacus. It is thus not
surprising that Russia's most majes¬
tic pillar church, the Belfry of Ivan
Veliky in the Kremlin, Moscow,
should be dedicated to this saint. Its
superb set of bells (blagovest, the an¬
nunciator of blessed news) symbo¬
lize the mission of Our Lady as the
ladder by which God descended into
this world, connecting the Annunci¬
ation of the New Testament with
Jacob's Ladder of the Old. Stone
tiered churches often had sets of
bells in the upper tier. Among the
finest of them is the church of the
Intercession of Our Lady in the
Moscow suburb of Fill.
Flamboyant churches, typified by
the use of round or pointed arches
known as kokoshniki, began to be
built in Russia in the fifteenth cen
tury. At first structural features but
later purely decorative additions to
the main dome, kokoshniki symbolize
the tongues of heavenly fire and are
a metaphor for the heavenly host.
The profusion of these features and
the variety of their shapes stand for
the variety and number of angels and
saints. The main cubic body of the
edifice embodied the Church Militant,
the upper part with its kokoshniki the
Church Triumphant, and the cupola
above them God, Head of the Church.
The earliest flamboyant churches
were built in honour of important
historical events, and the first fully
accomplished example of the style
can be seen in two naves of the
Church of the Transformation of Our
Lord built in the 1520s on the site
of the church erected by prince
Dmitri Donskoy to commemorate his
victory over the Tatars at the battle
of Kulikovo in 1380. In the mid-
sixteenth century, victories over the
Tatars in Kazan and Astrakhan were
commemorated with the addition of
four similar naves to the Cathedral
of the Holy Trinity in Moscow's Red
Square, wrongly known as the Church
of St. Basil the Blessed.
Some churches incorporate several
styles. The Church of the Transfigu¬
ration of Our Lord at Ostrovo near
Moscow is a fantastic blend of the
tent-roof, flamboyant and multi-
cupola styles. The greatest achieve¬
ment of old Russian architecture, the
Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Red
Square, is also a remarkable blend of
styles. The whole structure is ar¬
ranged around the tent-roofed
Church of the Intercession of Our
Lady, with pillar naves on each of the
four sides, a flamboyant nave at each
of the four corners, and a sumptu¬
ous cluster of ornate cupolas above
the whole. The Cathedral is the quin¬
tessential expression of the Russian
concept of the Christian Church.
