PRE-COLUMBIAN
AMERICA

LESS than a quarter of a
century has passed since
pre-Columbian sculpture, ceramics and
metal-work first appeared in art exhi¬
bitions. Before being accepted as great
art, the works of the peoples who
lived on the American continent when
the Old World was unaware of its
existence were the subject of the most
outlandish judgements.
The reaction of an artist of such un¬
disputed taste as Albrecht Dürer to
the first examples of American work¬
manship to reach Europe should
have revealed from the outset that
here was genuine art. In 1520 the
great German painter had the oppor¬
tunity of seeing the gifts which the
Mexicans had sent by Cortez to the
Emperor Charles V. Filled with won¬
der at the "subtle genius", of the
inhabitants of the New World, he wrote
in his journal that never had he seen
anything so beautiful.
Among the first groups of Spaniards
to set foot in America, who alone had
the privilege of seeing the American
civilizations still unspoiled, there were
but few artists. Even so, some of the
Conquistadores were enlightened
enough to set other values on the
jewellery than the mere market price
of its gold. These men left chronicles
filled with admiration for the ornaments
of life in these American civilizations.
Bernai Diaz del Castillo gives an en¬
thusiastic description of the town of
Tenochtitlan; in an inventory of the
"treasure" of the 0ueen Anacoana,
Petrus Martyr dwells on the beauty of
the carved wooden seats called
"duho . . ."
Nevertheless, the artistic merit of
the objects brought back from Ame¬
rica escaped most of those who saw
HENRI LEHMANN is an assistant director
of the Musée de l'Homme, Paris, and
curator of its American collection. Well
known as an anthropologist and archaelo-
gist, he is the author of many studies on
pre-Columbian civilization; among his works
for the general reader are "Civilisations
précolombiennes" in the "Que sais-je ?"
collection published by the Presses Univer¬
sitaires de France, Paris, 1965; and "L'Art
Précolombien" , published by Editions Mas-
sin, Paris, 1960.
them in the sixteenth century; people
were simply surprised by their exotic
character, till then unknown. These
articles were much sought after but
only in order that they might take their
place in collections of curios. Fashions
changed, and no more was heard of
pre-Columbian products.
The end of the 18th century brought
about a revival of interest in the an¬
cient civilizations of America, now not
so much for their external forms as for
their content. The lead was given by
Alexander von Humboldt, scholar of
many parts, naturalist and ardent ex¬
plorer. In the course of extensive tra¬
vels in America, and notably in Mexico,
he saw sculptures, illuminated manus¬
cripts, divers vestiges of a bygone age.
His scientific outlook impelled him to
make an analytical study of these re¬
mains, and with his work began the
systematic examination of Mexican
manuscripts, and of the Aztec calendar
and symbolism. "Americanism" de¬
veloped into a science whose disciples
became ever more numerous . . .
Some specialists of this period
were interested in the religions, others
in the history, and others again in the
economic or social life of the conti¬
nent. No one, however, was concern¬
ed with its art; all seem to have been
quite indifferent to pre-Columbian aes¬
thetics. This lack of understanding was
blatantly displayed at the first inter¬
national congress of Americanists, held
at Nancy in 1875. The curator of the
American collections at the Anthropo¬
logical Museum in St. Petersburg de¬
clared:
"The monuments of American anti¬
quity arriving in Europe will continue to
increase in numbers, but not in beauty.
We are even compelled to say that in
the matter of art and aesthetics it
appears that no antique civilization is
worse off than that of America; a
single glance at the collections in the
Louvre is sufficient to convince one of
this, and the St. Petersburg collection
only confirms the impression . . . This
absence of all plastic beauty in the
works of aboriginal American art is a
fact which may perhaps pass unnoticed
by ethnographers and archaeologists,
but which artists are coming to
deplore, and which, in the eyes of the
historian, is of supreme importance.
For, in point of fact, he may infer from
it that as the ancient Americans were
entirely lacking in a feeling for beauty,
so were they destitute of all moral
sense..." The curator concluded this
bitter attack with a merciless condem¬
nation "Thus are these peoples (of an¬
cient America) quite dead and buried;
they lacked all lofty and noble aspir¬
ations and the sacred fire of great art
was unknown the them..."
In 1928 the Pavillon de Marsan, in
Paris, opened its doors to an exhibition
of "TheAncientArtsofAmerica", organ¬
ised by Georges-Henri Rivière, in
collaboration with Alfred Métraux. It
created such a stir that the Berlin
Academy of Fine Arts followed the
example given by Paris and four years
later presented a pre-Columbian exhi¬
bition. As a result of these exhibitions
several important private collections
were started. The Second World War
interrupted the activity of initiates, but
in 1947, on the occasion of the first
international meeting of Americanists
since the war the Musée de l'Homme
in Paris exhibited its "Masterpieces of
Pre-Columbian America," emphasizing
above all their aesthetic character.
The choice of the word "master¬
pieces" was in itself an indication of
the ground covered since the first con¬
gress. All the same, pre-Columbian
art had still not really come into its
own; it was described as a primitive
art, even when it was admitted to be
the product of "advanced" civiliza¬
tions. The exhibition of 1947 only par¬
tially succeeded in conquering these
prejudices . . .
How can we explain this prolong¬
ed denial of a form of plastic expres¬
sion which today arouses such enthu-
siam? It is probably to a compara¬
tive study of this art and that of the
Old World that we must look for the
answer.
On either side of the Atlantic, peo¬
ples which up to the 16th century had
had no contact with each other, invent¬
ed and developed arts under such
different conditions and with intentions
so diametrically opposed that when 97
they came face to face, they were
unable to discover their own system of
values in the opposite camp. European

art is commonly defined as the
expression through man's works of an
ideal of beauty. The quest for beauty
is not in itself the aim of pre-Colum¬
bian art ; art for art's sake was for the
ancient Americans so totally inconcei¬
vable that certain critics have termed
their art an extra-artistic phenomenon.
Nearly all pre-Columbian sculptures,
paintings, ceramics, etc. are intended
for cult purposes. They were used in
the countless religious ceremonies per¬
formed according to elaborate rites,
and for which the temples, statues,
vases, vestments, and trappings had
constantly to be renewed. The pre-
Columbian Pantheon was exacting, and
merciless ; what was expected from
men was not, as in the Christian reli¬
gion, a particular moral attitude, but
food in the form of mortification, offer¬
ings and sacrifices. The gods requir¬
ed regular sustenance, and if men had
abstained from their duty, they would
have let loose the worst catastrophes:
defeats, accidents, drought, even the
end of the world. Thus the art of
those who produced the objects of
such a cult was not free and dis¬
interested, but utilitarian.
As far as the ornaments and acces¬
sories of so tyrannical a religion were
concerned, their office was to inspire
terror, not love. Since these gods,
beyond human understanding, could
not be represented in a realistic hu¬
man form, the tendency was to suggest
their presence by a collection of sym¬
bolic elements, or again by a conven¬
tional group of realistic elements with
no logical connexion between them.
Hence those strange monsters which
for so long shocked European eyes...
When the Greeks wished to por¬
tray Demeter, they gave her the form
and features of any beautiful woman.
The Aztec Coatlicue, as she is to be
seen in the museum in Mexico City,
has only a very vaguely human form;
she is a Cyclopean block, adorned
with serpents' heads, claws, and a
necklace of hearts and severed
hands. The statue evokes purely and
simply the principle of generation and

MAYA WHISTLE
As it spread out
over vast areas
of central America,
attaining its zenith
between 300 and 900 A.D.,
the Maya civilization
produced an art
of exceptional richness
and complexity.

THE GOD VENUS
Bearded head decorating
an incense burner (below)
was made by a 14th century
Maya artist in Guatamala.
It is believed to be
an incarnation of Quetzalcoatl,
the god of civilization, also represented
as a feathered serpent and,
in human form, as bearded
and white skinned. Tradition
taught that after bringing
the arts and sciences
to the Valley of Mexico,
Quetzalcoatl became the planet
Venus, and that as the morning
star he would one day return
from the east.
When bearded white men eventually
landed on the eastern coast,
the myth was still
so widely believed that
it paralyzed any chance of
organized resistance.
of destruction, the mother, and the
tomb, of all temporal life.
The necessity of an enormous out¬
put to satisfy the requirements of the
cult, meant that all the artists of the
pre-Columbian period were pressed
into its service. They were trained
according to tradition, and organized
into corporations, whose rules were as
strict as those of the religious orders.
One might call them craftsmen, for
they were considered as such. When
all were destined for the collective
task, it would have been inadmissible
for some to have been inferior to
others: everyone was required to attain
the same technical perfection.
A specialist, or a group of specia¬
lists sculptors, painters, potters, or
feather dressers would be charged
with a particular piece of work. This
would have to be executed in confor¬
mity with strict predetermined rules,
themselves an expression of the col¬
lective will of society. The style derives
from these rules hence the very marked
uniformity in the style of each site, or
rather, of each tribe. On the other
hand, the art of individual races is
highly characteristic, and it is impossi¬
ble to confuse one with another.
For example, the style of the Atlan¬
tes of Tula Toltec work has nothing
in common with that of the famous
calendar in the Mexico City Museum,
which is Aztec work. Thanks to the
fidelity of the pre-Columbian peoples
to their art styles, it is possible to trace
their migrations. Thus at Palenque we
see the Mayas at the summit of their
artistic achievement; when we come
upon them again at Chichen Itza, their
style is no longer pure; foreign motifs
have been incorporated in it. They
are the motifs created at Tula by the
Toltecs, and brought with them when
they came to settle at Chichen Itza...
Stylistic unity is the negation of
individualism. It is difficult' for us to
imagine that art can attain its fullest
expression without the individual con¬
tributions of artists, and it is from this
standpoint that we admire the works
of the great European painters and

sculptors. But the individual contribu¬
tion does not appear in pre-Columbian
artistic creations. These are, more¬
over, never signed.
In Europe, we generally feel some¬
what reticent about anonymous works,
preferring that the object should bear
a signature. It is more satisfying to
our minds to be able to call by his
name the creator of a statue of Aphro¬
dite, of the Descent from the Cross, of
the Holy Family or of the Pilgrims at
Emmaüs, than to talk of that intangible
and depersonalized being who was the
master of Chichen Itza or of Tula.
It is true that our sculpture too re¬
mained anonymous during a part of the
Middle Ages and that the statues of
the cathedrals of Chartres, Rheims,
and Strasbourg seem to us no less
remarkable for all that. The fact is
that these statues are so clearly dif¬
ferentiated in their detail that it is quite
a simple matter to distinguish not only
the various masters, but even the
work of a master from that of his
pupils . . .
Should we say then that pre-Colum¬
bian art is entirely destitute of indi¬
vidualism? It is tempting to reply in
the affirmative; but it seems, never¬
theless, that certain Peruvian works
possess some individuality. The an¬
thropomorphic terracotta heads of the
North coast, which belong to the
Mochica civilization, allow a glimpse,
in certain unmistakable personal
touches, of the hand of one particular
artist . . .
Fifteen years ago, I attempted to
prove that according to European stan¬
dards anonymity and the absence of
individualism are characteristic of
what we term primitive art. Now it is
not possible to describe as primitives
the men who built the great Peruvian
towns of Cuzco, Machu Picchu, and
Cajamarquilla, nor again those who
constructed the pyramids of Mexico,
or of the Mayan zone in Guatemala and
Honduras. They were undeniably
great artists who had attained the sum¬
mit of their art. Their spiritual motives
alone had no connexion with those of
European artists.
Their conception of technique may
also disconcert the European observer.
On this point, by comparing, or rather,
contrasting the art of the two Worlds,
Alfred Schuster has propounded a new
theory (1). According to him, European
art is fundamentally linear and "two-
dimensional", the work being conceiv¬
ed in terms of lines and planes; pre-
Columbian art, on the other hand, is
plastic and "three-dimensional", its
success depending on the balance of
volumes . . .
Anonymity, an absence of indivi¬
dualism, a collective, social, magic-
religious, perhaps also, three-dimen¬
sional nature these are some specific
features by which pre-Columbian art
may be contrasted with European art;
these probably are the reasons for
which it remained so long ill-judged.
That time is fortunately now past, and
ancient America has henceforth ac¬
quired its proper status in the realm
of great art.
