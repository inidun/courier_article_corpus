This open talk is how some teachers in the
Netherlands approach sexuality with stu-
dents between 12 and 15 ye a rs old. S u b-
sidised by the Dutch gove rn m e n t , the “L a n g
l e ve de liefde” (“Long Live Love”) package wa s
d e veloped in the late 1980s, when AI D S
became recognised as a threatening health
p r o b l e m . “A I D S was an impetus for sex edu-
c ation in schools,” s ays Jo Reinders of Soa-
b e s t ri j d i n g, the Dutch foundation for STD
(sexually transmitted diseases) control,w h i c h
d e veloped the package in consultation with
c h u r c h e s , health officials and family plan-
ning organizat i o n s. “It forced teachers to
become more explicit and to discuss norm s
and values using a part i c i p at o ry approach.”
Decision-making skills
With the lowest teenage pregnancy rat e
in Europe (8.4 per 1,000 girls between 15
and 19), any initiative in the Netherlands
d e s e rves at t e n t i o n . “There is no country
that has invested so much in research into
family planning…, media attention and
improvement of service delivery than the
N e t h e r l a n d s ,” wrote experts from the
Netherlands Institute of Social and Sexo-
logical Research (NISSO) in a specialised
j o u rn a l . Although the country has no
mandatory national curriculum, nearly all
s e c o n d a ry schools provide sex educat i o n
as part of biology classes and over half the
c o u n t ry ’s pri m a ry schools address sexu-
ality and contraception. According to H.
R o l i n g, a professor of education at the Uni-
versity of Amsterdam,“the Dutch govern-
ment has always accepted the fact that edu-
c ation was better than denial,” and the
subject has been tackled in schools since the
1970s.
Since 1993, the gove rn m e n t , w i t h o u t
s t i p u l ating the contents of classes, h a s
stressed that schools should aim to gi ve stu-
dents the skills to take their own decisions
regarding health, and in particular sexu-
a l i t y.Textbooks were revised and according
to Reinders ,n ow take a more “ c o m p r e h e n-
s i ve approach to sexuality.The curri c u l u m
focuses on biological aspects of reproduction
as well as on va l u e s , at t i t u d e s ,c o m m u n i c a-
tion and negotiation skills.” Some schools
simply use these textbooks, o t h e rs comple-
ment them with the foundat i o n ’s pack,
which includes a video, a teacher’s manual
and a student magazine. “The educat i o n
system is ve ry much built not only around
transmitting knowledge but giving the skills
to apply that knowledge in eve ry d ay life,”
s ays Reinders. “Decision-making skills are
ve ry import a n t .”
But sex education in schools is not enough
to explain the Dutch record. The Rutgers
Fo u n d at i o n , a family planning associat i o n
t h at has launched several large-scale public
i n f o rm ation campaigns in the past decades,
sees a constellation of other fa c t o rs.The media
has been at the forefront of an open dialogue:
b e t ween 1993 and 1997, a prime-time talk
s h ow featured a leading Dutch pop star
discussing sexuality. C o n-
f i d e n t i a l i t y, g u a r a n t e e d
a n o nymity and a non-judg-
mental approach are hall-
marks of the health care
s y s t e m . Last but not least,
“parents in the Netherlands
take a ve ry pragmat i c
a p p r o a c h . They know their
children are going to have
s e x , and they are ready to
prepare them and to speak
with them about their
r e s p o n s i b i l i t y.This is the key
wo r d ,” s ays Mischa Heeger
of the Rutgers Fo u n d at i o n .
C o n t r a c e p t i ves are widely
u s e d .According to a NISSO
s t u d y, 85 per cent of sexually
a c t i ve young people use a
c o n t r a c e p t i ve , and the pill is
freely ava i l a b l e .The ave r a g e
age of a yo u t h ’s first sexual
i n t e r c o u rse is 17.7 ye a rs.
Even with this record,
the Fo u n d ation for STD
control recognises that it is
still difficult for many teachers to talk with
students about sexuality, despite training
p r ovided over the ye a rs , notably by the Rut-
gers Foundation. Family planning organi-
z ations are also concerned about the higher
rates of teenage pregnancy among Turkish
and Moroccan gi r l s , and are deve l o p i n g
p r o grammes specially geared towards them.
But the country’s record has attracted
attention from abroad.The Rutgers Fo u n-
d ation provides training to doctors and
social workers as well as assistance to edu-
cation ministries in developing curricula,
notably in Central and Eastern Europe and
Central A s i a . To some critics who argue
that “talking about sex gives children the
wrong idea,” Jos Poelman of the Fo u n d at i o n
for STD control has one answe r.“ Face the
fa c t s.We have the lowest number of teenage
mothers [in Europe], and Dutch students
do not start having sex at a younger age than
their foreign counterparts.” ■
