Artists and scientists
delve into the lost
secret of encaustic
painting a long
forgotten art technique
by
Lucio and Giuseppe
Attinelli
WIDE-EYED BEAUTY of a young woman (left)
was captured by an encaustic painter over seventeen
centuries ago. Portrait, believed to depict a member
of the family of Pollius Sotor, Archon (magistrate) of
Thebes is on wood and was found in a necropolis at
Fayoum, Egypt. Bacchante (above) was executed as
an encaustic on marble by a contemporary French
painter, Helen Mai, who seems to have re-discovered
methods used by ancient painters. Encaustic fresco
(opposite page), depicting two women playing with
a goat, was found at Pompeii. Painted in the first
century A.D., it is now in the Louvre Museum.

When volcanic dust and ashes
rained down upon the town of
Pompeii, life there expired.
But the stones of Pompeii have lived
to tell its story, and, more amazing
still, a strange type of painting resist¬
ed the heat and dust to provide later
generations with a fascinating glimp¬
se of an art which might be said to
have disappeared with the Roman
Empire.
Through the centuries many at¬
tempts have been made to find the
secret of this durable painting,
known as encaustic. Only recently
Italian scientists gave the most
exhaustive chemical tests to samples
of encaustic art from Pompeii
without discovering the secret of the
ancient formula. It looked as if it
would remain locked in mystery.
A Greek word for it
What in fact is this encaustic
painting which is, in its way,
the forefather of all modern
forms of painting? Its origins go back
to the dawn of European civilization.
Homer spoke of the ships with red
bows and Ovid has described* a ship's
stern painted and decorated with
burnt colours. Here, perhaps, is one
part of the secret, for the word en¬
caustic is derived from the Greek
egkaustikos meaning "burnt". All we
know is that the encaustic painters
used heated or liquid wax applied to
wood and stone in such a way that
they could be washed, scrubbed,
heated or left in the burning rays of
the sun without suffering damage.
Perhaps the most complete des¬
cription of this ancient form of paint¬
ing is found in Pliny. He has describ¬
ed three methods, all of which were
apparently in general use by the Ro¬
mans. The first, and most common
of these, he calls the spatula method.
In this a mixture of resin, wax and
colour was heated and applied to the
surface with a spatula. . This techni¬
que was probably used in Pompeii and
Herculaneum.
The second, used on polished wood
and ivory, consisted of saturating the
wax with colour and then applying
the "'paint" with a stylus. Roman
ships were usually painted by means
of the third method whereby liquefied
wax was applied to the planks with
a brush. This surface set so hard
that it was completely impervious to
effects of sun and sea water. How¬
ever, all three forms produced paint¬
ings of a nature far more durable
than anything which has been seen
since.
During the excavations at the
Graeco-Roman necropolis at Hawara
in Egypt portraits were found in
The Unesco Courier. Nr 1. 1956
which the vitality of expression and
the perfect state of preservation gave
eloquent testimony of their resistance
to the ravages of time. The dura¬
bility of wax, and its power to with¬
stand the effects of the atmosphere
were therefore well-known to the an¬
cient Greeks, Romans and Egyptians.
Pillaged portraits
It is this amazing resistance of an¬
cient encaustic paintings which
has spurred archaeologists and
others to try and discover their hidden
secret. Much of their research has, un¬
fortunately, been frustrated by wilful
vandalism. Such a case occurred in
Egypt in 1887 when an ancient ne¬
cropolis was pillaged by Bedouins
searching for salt on the desert's edge.
Everything was either burnt or
destroyed with the exception of some
portraits found in the mummy wrap¬
pings, which, according to ancient
Egyptian custom, depicted the de¬
funct person. These portraits were
sold and eventually found their way
to Vienna.
The scene at this necropolis has
been vividly described by a French
historian, Dr. Fouquet, who saw the
ground strewn with mummified
skeletons. At each mum- (Cont'd

Art of wax and fire

graved the name, quality and place
of birth. On the mummy casings
themselves were encaustic paintings
on wood, the majority of which were
in a perfect state of preservation.
The decline of the Roman Empire
saw also a decline in the art of en¬
caustic painting. But, later, with the
triumph of the Church it re-appeared
in Constantinople. Eusebius, the Pa¬
triarch of Constantinople, in 339 A.D.,
has described a vast encaustic paint¬
ing showing the Emperor Constantine
hurling a dragon (symbol of the
Church's enemies) into the waves.
After centuries of splendour, en¬
caustic art finally died out. Perhaps
it was thought too difficult and too
involved for the newer painters in
tempera and oils who were then
starting to come to the fore.
Delacroix dabbled
It was not until the eighteenth cen¬
tury that revival of interest
became apparent. In 1755 the
Paris Académie des Inscriptions
opened a competition to probe the
mystery of encaustic art. Work done
by two French painters, Caylus and
Bachelier, for this competition was not
crowned with success, although it did
have the effect of re-awakening pub¬
lic interest in this lost art form.
In the 19th century Delacroix and
his pupils experimented with wax .
painting but without the applica¬
tion of heat. Despite this they achiev¬
ed some significant results, and a good
Illustration of the work done can be
seen in the painting now hanging in
the French National Assembly show¬
ing Attila with his Huns withdrawing
across the ravaged plains
of Italy.
Tentative experiments
were also made in Italy,
but nearer our own times
a painter of great origi¬
nality, Henri Cros, after a
prolonged study of the
classical sources, produced
several paintings of wood¬
en horses. Although the
colours do not have the
brilliancy of true encaus¬
tic painting they do bear
some resemblance to it.
Unfortunately his work
was brought to an end by
his sudden death.
Today, a French paint¬
er, Helen Mai, living in
Paris, has attacked the
problem with renewed "
vigour. Piecing together
the fragments of informa¬
tion available from cent¬
uries-old documents, she
experimented and tested
a variety of chemical
combinations over a pe^
riod of many years.
Through her research and study she
has evolved a formula which, to judge
by her paintings, seems to correspond
to the work done by the encaustic
painters of ancient times.
The similarity between her paint¬
ings and the classical Roman works
is indeed striking.
One of her works, La Bacchante, an
encaustic painting on marble, for
example, shows traces of firing, and
suffers no damage when repeatedly
washed, scrubbed and brushed with
soap and water.
Among Helen Mai's other encaustic
paintings is a series on wood on the
Comedia dell'Arte and a Road to
Calvary specially done for a church
in N.W. France.
Although Helen Mai has not yet re¬
vealed the secret of her technique,
her achievement may well serve to re¬
vive interest in the lost art of en¬
caustic painting.
