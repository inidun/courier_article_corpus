“Tune in and drop out!” The old slogan
rings globally as teenagers , t we n t y -
somethings and adolescent-thirties plug
into music to disconnect from the worries of their
worlds. But in Belgrade, bands of young techno
fans are “dropping out” of society with a vehe-
mence which reflects more than mere defiance of
authority. In the Serbian context of rampant
n ationalism and corru p t i o n , their apoliticism
reflects a hardcore political statement as they cre-
ate a parallel universe whose members flow like
free electrons through the circuits of clubs,
underground parties and pirate music networks.
Outside of the Balkans, the act of “ d r o p p i n g
o u t ” usually means ignoring social pressures and
parental pleas to “plan for the future” by studying
or working hard to achieve social status and fin a n-
cial success. In Belgr a d e , youth are not just reject-
ing parental expectations but the probable future

of the majori t y : d e p ri vat i o n . Only the elite stand a
chance of economic escape in this country where
five per cent of the population owns 80 per cent of
the national we a l t h . In the last ten ye a rs , an esti-
m ated 250,000 teenagers and young adults have
left the country, mostly heading West to countri e s
like Germ a ny, A u s t ria and the Netherlands.
“We won’t be
fooled again!”
Only a surrealist could plan for the future in a
f e d e r ation that no longer exists. One minute yo u ’r e
high on the spirit of invading the streets with a
united opposition and the next moment the move-
ment implodes under the searing haze of police
tear gas. “ We wo n ’t be fooled again!” c ry the tech-
no tri b e s , who have learned to mistrust virt u a l l y
e ve ryone over thirty on either side of the political
d i v i d e . No tolerance for the petty bickering of

opposition “ l e a d e rs ” and no respect for the estab-
lishment—neither of which offer a clue on how to
heal the wounds of gr owing pove rty and cri m i n a l-
i s ation of the stat e .
This is not a resurrection of the generic youth
rebellion:“No future!” By creating a parallel uni-
verse via music, these techno tribes seem to be
building on the Temporary Autonomous Zone
(TAZ)1 of philosopher Hakim Bey, the anarchist
guru based in New York. Imagine “pirate utopias”
or “mini-societies living consciously outside of
the law and determined to keep it up,” writes Bey,
“even if only for a short but merry life.” For Bey,
a head-on collision with the state amounts to
“futile martyrdom”. Instead of wasting time in
the dogma-eats-dogma world of revo l u t i o n
(wherein one ideology is replaced by another),
consider the joys of uprising.“The TAZ is like an
uprising which does not engage directly with the
State,a guerrilla operation which liberates an area
(of land, of time, of imagination) and then dis-
solves itself to re-form elsewhere/elsewhen, before
the State can crush it.”
Veritable temples
for the alienated
B e l grade offers the ideal terrain for the TA Z .
The omnipresent State is riddled with cracks for
the tribes to disappear in. In fa c t , the techno scene
literally developed undergr o u n d : in the basement
of the State unive rs i t y ’s Faculty of A rts in 1992
(the apex of the former Yu g o s l av i a ’s bloody dis-
m e m b e rm e n t ) . The basement club A d a d e m i j a
staged a music coup, replacing the old revo l u t i o n-
a ry avant-garde of rock ’n’ roll bands with the gad-
get wizardry of techno disc jockeys.Tribes or bands
of teenagers and twenty-somethings form e d
around a common goal: to escape wa r - t o rn reality
for the futurism of techno. The undergr o u n d
e vents were like temples for the alienat e d : by pul-
s ating to a collective vibe, adherents silently swo r e
a l l e giance to the positive yet ephemeral life on the
d a n c e flo o r.
S l owly they built a parallel unive rse by almost
b o rr owing a page from Bey’s book: t u rn the negat i ve
into positive . Reject politics not by apat hy but by
c r e ating altern at i ve netwo r k s. Reject the capitalist
notion of wo r k , not by laziness,but through the black
e c o n o my.And so the techno tribes re-claimed space
in clubs and abandoned wa r e h o u s e s.Without cash
for equipment, they stealthily borr owe d , b a rt e r e d
for and recycled old turntables and speakers.W i t h-
out access to a record or CD fa c t o ry, they smuggled
p i r ate recordings from Bulgari a .
It’s as if they followed Bey’s words to the letter,
and yet most have probably never even heard of the
anarchist.Ask them about their motivation to find
vague talk of “positive change”and club culture as
“the only sane way of surviving” and fighting the
system.The lack of eloquence can be forgiven, for
these are doers ,l e aving philosophy for thinkers like
B e y. They don’t bother with what “ wa s ” or “ w i l l
be”—instead they raid the status quo. For example,
in 1996/7, the opposition held three months of
d e m o n s t r ations after the gove rnment tried to annul
their victory in local elections. Instead of following
the leaders,the techno tribes staged their own car-
nivalesque events.
D u ring the NATO bombing campaign against
B e l gr a d e , hundreds of reve l l e rs met for techno
p a rt i e s , organised by two 20-year olds, M a r k o
Nastic and Dejan Milicevic, k n own as the Te e n a g e
Techno Punks.The uprising flo ated with the sense
of utopia which, as Bey wri t e s ,“ e nvisions an i n t e n-
s i fic at i o n of eve ry d ay life, or as the Surr e a l i s t s
might have said, l i f e ’s penetration by the Marve l-
l o u s.”
Attacking the State’s
nostalgia for the past
“ S t rike at the structures of control!” e x h o rt s
B e y. And so the techno tribes file past the police
and take aim at the real source of gove rnment con-
t r o l :i d e a s. D e voted to the futurism associated with
m u s i c, they attack the Stat e ’s nostalgia for past
“glory”,while trampling on the notion that money
can pave the way to a better future as the State’s
printing machines churn out the bills of hyperin-
flation.By “dropping out”,the tribes won’t topple
the gove rnment or change their society. But that
was never their goal.As the underground leaders,
Teenage Techno Punks, e x p l a i n , “ I t ’s not easy to
be a drop-out, but,then again, it’s not easy to stay
put under the circumstances.This was the only way
we knew to bring about positive change.” ■
