The struggle
goes global
With economic and social rights now on the agenda, many new players have
emerged alongside older human rights organizations. In South Korea, women
are speaking out about their working conditions, and in Great-Britain the
homeless and badly-housed are voicing demands
While the unive rsality of human rights is
increasingly challenged, a gr ow i n g
number of activists is formally rejecting
any attempt to water down the principle with claims
of cultural relat i v i s m .The battle for human ri g h t s
has become universal.
“The United Nations conference in Vienna in
June 1993 shed light on a movement that had been
g at h e ring momentum since the late 1980s and
c o n f i rmed the emergence of local playe rs ,” s ay s
Antoine Bern a r d , e xe c u t i ve director of the
I n t e rn ational Fe d e r ation of Human Rights, w h o s e
membership rose from 66 in 1991 to 105 in 1997.
The gat h e rings held by non-gove rn m e n t a l
o r g a n i z ations (NGO) on the fringes of five United
N ations conferences between 1992 and 1995 brought
to light another major trend: the proliferation of
wo m e n ’s move m e n t s.They argue that women account
for half the wo r l d ’s population and must have the
same rights as men. Their pri o rity is fighting the
d i s c ri m i n ation and violence women endure
e ve rywhere in the wo r l d . So the community of human
rights activists has integr ated new, p r e v i o u s l y
m a r ginalized playe rs at the same time that the
movement has become global.
In A f ri c a , L atin A m e ri c a , Europe and, m o s t
r e c e n t l y,A s i a , the collapse or weakening of repressive
r e gimes has been fertile ground for a new crop of
human rights organizat i o n s.At first they were nat i o n a l
human rights groups and local branches of A m n e s t y
I n t e rn at i o n a l .To d ay they are more than just offshoots
of large organizations based in the countries of the
N o rt h . An often impressive number of home-gr ow n
groups has taken up where intern ational organ i z at i o n s
* Singapore and Canada
proposed that the ICC would
stay out of situations if the
Security Council told it to, for a
12-month renewable period.

left off as economic and social changes spawn the
need for new forms of solidarity.
Ayo Obe,the Nigerian chairwoman of the Civil
L i b e rties Organisat i o n , s ays foreign aid and cash
helped launch such gr o u p s. But today activists,m a ny
of them vo l u n t e e rs , are legi o n . Their pri m a ry
o b j e c t i ves are to “ i m p r ove society,” to make up for the
lack of gove rnment action and to fight discri m i n at i o n ,
damage to the environment and stat e - i n s p i r e d
v i o l e n c e . Those goals are shared by most A f ri c a n
c o u n t ries which have seen the most spectacular
growth of human rights organizations.
Previously underground and exiled activists laid
the gr o u n d work for the proliferation of human ri g h t s
groups in the late 1980s.“The human rights move m e n t
in Latin A m e rica was already quite advanced before
the dictat o rships fell,but it was politically confrontat i o n a l
and centred on large organizat i o n s ,” s ays Bern a r d .
“ To d ay groups are highly dive rse and do a lot of in-
depth wo r k , especially to raise awareness of the law.”
In the former communist countri e s , the human
rights movement has also gr own by leaps and bounds
since the Berlin wall fell in 1989.“As soon as the Sov i e t
empire showed the first evident signs of collapse,
numerous NGOs sprang up all over the USSR,” s ay s
B o ris Pustintsev, c h a i rman of Citizens Wat c h .
While the first generation of human rights gr o u p s
“resisted gove rn m e n t ’s attempts to curb the
d e m o c r at i z ation process,” s ays Pustintsev, the second
wave has focused mainly on limiting the damage caused
by the ensuing social cri s i s. In Eastern
E u r o p e , as ye s t e r d ay ’s dissidents move d
into positions of powe r ,civil society wa s
left without its best defenders.G r a s s r o o t s
i n i t i at i ves did not pick up again until two
or three ye a rs ago.The still-fragile gr o u p s
c o n c e n t r ate on bu rning issues such as
the defence of minori t i e s.
The battle for human rights came later to Asia,
where dictatorships die harder. Asian activists took
a d vantage of the opportunities opened up by the
transition to democracy, especially in the Philippines
in 1986 and South Korea in 1987. Since then they
h ave stepped up their effort s. They are highly
o r g a n i z e d , use stat e - o f - t h e - a rt communicat i o n
technology and have formed regional federat i o n s.
One of their pri o rities is the dismantling of the
“national security” laws which governments use to
justify their cruellest acts of violence.
The human rights movement may be global and
r e l at i vely we l l - o r g a n i z e d , but it still has a long way
to go. E ve ry day, activists must cope with a lack of
skill and funding as well as with repression that is
increasingly multi-fa c e t e d .They must also learn how
to co-operate with the authorities while maintaining
a critical distance from them.
The Russian gove rnment may be weak and
u n r e l i a b l e , but it has taken several steps in the ri g h t
d i r e c t i o n , s ays Pustintsev. Independent NGOs must
help and advise the gove rnment and act as a link to
o r d i n a ry citizens.“But it’s hard to play this new role,”
Pustintsev say s ,because the gove rn m e n t ’s old reflex of
taking control of any initiat i ve by civil society is still
a l i ve and we l l .
Faced with new problems, human rights activists
must move ahead by trial and err o r. In North A f ri c a
they started out by imitating the European model.B u t
t o d ay, s ays Moroccan historian Driss el-Ya z a m i , t h e
m ovement has “a historically new mission: to limit the
clashes between Islamic fundamentalists and the stat e .”
He says that members of human rights gr o u p s ,wo m e n ’s
rights activists and journalists who side with the
a u t h o rities in the fight against religious fundamentalism
are missing the chance to establish unquestionable
l e gi t i m a cy in their societies.To achieve that goal,he say s ,
“they must try to play the role of pacifiers and
m e d i at o rs.”
The upheavals of the 1990s have
affected the countries of the North as
we l l . Older organizations have
s t ruggled for a new lease of life while a
n e w, younger and more aggr e s s i ve
form of activism has appeared.
As inequality has increased,
“radical activity has moved to the social arena,” says
Martine Bartélémy, an expert on NGOs at France’s
N ational Political Science Fo u n d at i o n .B ritish law ye r
Michael Ellman adds that NGOs are becoming highly
specialized and increasingly resorting to direct action.
He cites organizations defending the rights of wo m e n ,
h o m o s e x u a l s , children and the homeless.“ People are
no longer taking action because they have some ove r a l l
project to change society,” s ays Bart é l é my, “ bu t
because they have a specific goal and want to achieve
it immediately.”
N o n - g ove rnmental organizations are highly dive rs e
but moving in the same direction. N o rth and South,
economic and social issues are taking precedence.
E ven human rights groups are campaigning against
social exclusion. “Our biggest need is to make the
connection between civil and political rights and
economic and social ri g h t s ,” s ays Ja ri bu Hills, US co-
o r d i n ator of the Southern Human Rights Organizers ’
N e t wo r k . “ We can’t fight against police bru t a l i t y
without fighting against extreme pove rty and the
economic production system,” she say s.
As they continue their struggle around the wo r l d ,
activists have demonstrated that human rights really
are a unive rsal ideal. N ow they want to prove that
they are indivisible. n
