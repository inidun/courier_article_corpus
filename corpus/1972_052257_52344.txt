lover's pipe-dream. Yet thanks to the
pioneering work of two Channel Island
inventors this dream is well on the
way to becoming reality.
The basic idea of reducing the
contents of a book, magazine or news¬
paper, or bulky reference records is
not new. Hospitals have long been
using microfilming methods as a
means of storing ex-patients medical
case histories, and as early as 1930
microfilmed reprints of items from
American newspapers were available.
After the Second World War,
libraries made use of microfilm
editions to complete their collections
of out of print or rare books. At present
the motor car industry is making great
use of micro-catalogues and main¬
tenance manuals which they issue to
their dealers and agents. Many
magazines, particularly technical ones,
can now be published in microfiche
form with up to 70 pages available on
a microfiche (a sheet of film) no bigger
than a postcard.
Unfortunately, a fairly bulky reader
is required to reproduce the micro¬
fiche in readable form. These gener-

graphic process its

"We have taken spec¬
tacles off the eyes and
put them on the book",
says George Davies,
inventor of a new type
of micro-size book
which relies on micro-
printing rather than
photographic reduc¬
tion. Far left, an early

stand is not essential
and the book is nor¬
mally held on the lap.

books seen on this
mini-bookcase are the
equivalent of about 360
average-sized paper¬
backs, an incredible
saving in space and
paper. World consump¬
tion of newsprint, prin¬
ting and writing paper
now totals some 50
million metric tons a
year. 500,000 trees have
to be felled annually to
provide the pulp requi¬

"tree". One symbol
signifies a single tree
and two or three grou¬
ped together mean a
wood or forest.

'ally resemble a small television
receiver in appearance, and although
lap readers are now being put on the
market they are still rather cumber¬
some and are not the sort of thing
the average book-lover would want
to curl up with by the fire on a cold
winter's evening.
It was at this point that George
Davies and Hedda Wertheimer of the
Channel Islands came on the scene.
They decided that the answer to pro¬
ducing an easily handled micro-size
book (*) was to be found in micro-prin¬
ting rather than in photographic minia¬
turisation of books printed in the nor¬
mal way. Their experiments showed
that micro-printing, at a 10 to I reduc¬
tion on normal print size was feasible
on standard offset litho presses.
For their books they decided to use
polypropylene paper which, although
only a third the thickness of a micro¬
fiche, can take printing on both sides
and results, for an average size book,
¡n a micro version of ten 5 in. by
5 1/2 in. double-sided pages. A micro-
library unit of ten books, including
a somewhat thicker cover, would be
about the same bulk as an average
paperback.
To read the book a pair of binocular
lenses is required. These fold flat
when not in use to the size of a
slightly thicker than usual bookmark.
In use they are held in place by a
magnetized strip t>f steel placed
behind the page being read.
Since binocular lenses are used.
double images have to be printed.
Though this takes additional space
it has the advantage that three dimen¬
sional illustrations can be used.
Furthermore, since the lenses are
adjustable, people of all ages can read
micro-print without strain.
The biggest problem that remains
is to get general acceptance of the
idea. People are naturally unwilling to
buy the readers until they are sure that
there will be micro-size books to read;
on the ' other hand, publishers want
to be sure of a reading public before
they plunge into micro-printing.
