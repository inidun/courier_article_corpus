Where we live, in the mountainous
Fouta-Djalon region of northern Guinea
—known as West A f r i c a ’s “ w a t  r
tower”—the peasants have only very
small plots, just a few hundred squar
metres each.
During th  rainy season, they harvest
ric  and maize for th ir own
c o  s u mp t i o n , and omatoes,potat es and
onions to sell. In good tim s and bad,
they earn between $200 and $270 a year,
which they somehow make d  with.
Everythi g is far away.To get a simple
b lt for a m chine,w  sometimes have to go
ll the way to the capital,C o n a k r y.We do ’t
have legal tit e to our land, whic  m ans
that we can’t stand up to individuals or the
government when they want to claim it.
We don’t h ve enough labour. Th e
y ng are all leaving, especially the men,
and often for abroa .W  ’re very short f
money to modernize our farms.We hav
to pay about 30 percent interest if we
take out loans from government-
controlled credit agencies and private
banks.
Yet despite ll this, w e ’re managing to
produce crops that are comp titive on
the domestic mark t,not just compared
with other national products but also
foreig  ones, sinc  the market was totally
opened up a dec de ago.When we decid
on somethi g, we carry it thro gh to th
en d .We do what we say we’ll do.We don’t
lie to people.We show them results.Th a t’s
why we’re su cessful.
The F uta-Djalon Peas ts’
Federation, founded in 1992, today has
12,500 members, two-thirds of them
w o m e n , who share farm work equally
with men. It buys eeds and fertiliz r
ch ap y to sell to th members. It builds
b a r n s, roads and bridges and runs literacy
cou ses. Its 18 experts help the pea ants
t  i prove their f rming methods, b u t
there ren’t e ough people ike them.
The federation also g v s classes in basic
accou ting and how to sell products to
 e r c h a n t .Foreig  aid organizations and
NGOs help us in various ways, w h i c h
works out at ro ghly $40 per memb r
each year.
It took us time bec use we’re dealing
with long-term development. D o n o r s
often want quick results, but we know
that if w  go too fast, w e ’ll fall flat on our
f ace.The r sul is th re for all to see.O ur
potato yields are now 3,000 kilos per
h e c ta r e. From 1992 to 1998, we man g d
to get the government to block foreign
potato imports at harvest ime.We don’t
need that pr tection any more.
Agro-industry costs the country and
the consumer a lot of money. It h s al o
failed beca s peasants are not just part of
the economy, t h e y ’re also part of soc ety,
local culture and the environme t. So
developing countries have to take another
path—a “third way”—the path of family
f a r m i  g, bu an improved version of it.
Guinea is still not s lf-sufficient a d
imports rice from southeast A s i a . B u t
ca  we keep on appealing to foreign
countries to feed us when that’s our job?
