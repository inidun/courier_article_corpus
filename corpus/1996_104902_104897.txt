baroque".
Five hundred years ago, when Spain
was at the height of her power, the
Philippines were the Spanish
empire's easternmost fringe. The jour¬
ney from Madrid to the faraway
colony took many months. A trans-
Atlantic crossing to South America
was followed by an overland journey to
Acapulco in Mexico, and then a voyage
across the Pacific from Acapulco to
Manila, the Philippine capital.
From the sixteenth to the nine¬
teenth centuries, many Spanish fri¬
ars embarked on this hazardous
journey in order to spread the word
of God in their country's Asian out
post. When they arrived in the
Philippines, they discovered an agri¬
cultural and seafaring society.
People lived in huts built of bam¬
boo, rattan and palm clustered along
the seashore or on river banks. The
huts were raised above the ground
on stilts to prevent damage from sea¬
sonal flood waters and looked like
large baskets cradled on poles.
Although they responded per¬
fectly to the tropical island environ¬
ment, these traditional dwellings were
not intended to last forever. They
burned quickly and were easily blown
away by the typhoons that came
yearly. Constructed out of light, ten¬
sile materials, they swayed during
gentle earth tremors but collapsed
with the onset of the powerful earth¬
quakes that periodically ravaged the
country. However, fashioned as they
were out of natural materials that
grew abundantly near the villages,
they could soon be rebuilt.
The Spanish friars, used to large,
lofty, strong stone churches built to
last for a thousand years, did not
regard these impermanent struc¬
tures as proper dwellings for God.
They introduced the Western con¬
cept of permanence in architecture
to the Philippines, and also the use
of stone for building.
The friars directed teams of
skilled Filipino and Chinese crafts¬
men who were unaware of Western
construction techniques and the for-
malistic sensibilities of ecclesiastical
art. The construction of a church
was a community effort, and most
churches in the Philippines cannot
be ascribed to a single designer or
architect. They are the product of
collaborative work by many unknown
artisans.
The friars were guided by their
vague recollections of churches they
had seen before leaving their native
Spain, and built structures in a visu¬
ally delightful, highly personalized
Philippine style adapted from
Spanish baroque. As more and more
churches were built, this form of
"peripheral baroque" developed and

captured the imagination of the
Filipinos. A highly individualistic
variant of Spanish colonial archi¬
tecture, it became an enduring, but
today severely endangered, testi¬
mony to the interaction that suc¬
cessfully integrated two diverse cul¬
tures, uniting the visual sensibilities
of West and East.
In 1993, the following four archi¬
tecturally outstanding Spanish
Colonial churches of the Philippines
were included on the World
Heritage List.
The church of St. Augustine
(Paoay, llocos Norte province)
Built in 1710 by the Augustinians,
this ensemble of church and
detached bell tower standing on the
edge of a broad plaza is majestic in
scale. Its triangular, pedimented
façade of soft stone, plain at the bot¬
tom, is decorated with light, elegant
carving near the top of the pediment,
which is edged with a row of stone
ftnials (pinnacle ornaments) like
feathers delicately brushing the sky.
Thick perpendicular stone but¬
tresses protrude from the church
wall to protect the main structure
from earthquakes. The buttresses
are designed as huge double volutes
(swirl forms), and their interplay of
curves and counter-curves gives an
impression of magical lightness.
Reinforcing the Oriental flavour,
the bell tower situated a short dis
tance away from the principal
church structure tapers slightly
upwards in layers reminiscent of a
pagoda. Its side entrances are
flanked by floral motifs carved with
a fluidity accentuated by clouds
floating above them. The ethereal
grace of the façade softens the heavy
architectural elements, and the
visual reference linking the archi¬
tecture to the great Indonesian
shrine of lîorobudur brings an
Oriental aspect to the Catholic rit¬
uals performed inside the church.
The church of Our Lady
of the Assumption
(Santa Maria, llocos Sur province)
This ensemble of church and parish
residence built by the Augustinians
overlooks the town of Santa Maria
from a platform atop a flight of
eighty-five steps made of wide gran¬
ite blocks imported from China.
Instead of its façade, it presents its
austere, almost windowless sides to
the town below. The residence, con¬
nected by an arcaded bridge to the
church structure, faces the church
and completes the architectural
ensemble. As with the church of St.
Augustine at Paoay, buttresses swirl
upwards to reinforce the side walls
against earthquake damage. The
detached pagoda-like bell tower
stands a short distance from the main
façade to prevent it from falling on
the main structure if is toppled by an

earthquake. The charm of the Santa
Maria ensemble lies in its hilltop set¬
ting. The church buildings implanted
solidly above the town resemble a for¬
tified medieval citadel.
The church of St. Augustine
(Intramuros, Manila)
Ruilt in 1587 under the direction of
Augustinians, this is the oldest exist¬
ing stone church in the Philippines
and one of few examples of ecclesi¬
astical architecture in the Intramuros,
the fortified settlement built by the
Spaniards along the shores of Manila
Hay. Huilt as the Mother House of
the Augustinian Order in the
Philippines and in Asia, the
Renaissance style complex includes
the main church, monasteries, clois¬
ters and botanical gardens. The
ensemble is contained within an entire
city block. The austere façade of the
church faces a small plaza guarded
by a pair of Chinese stone dogs.
Instead of extending outwards from
the walls, the thick buttresses built
to protect the church against earth¬
quake damage are incorporated
inside the building in a series of sump¬
tuously decorated side chapels lin¬
ing both sides of the church. The only

tion , the ravages of a world wa r and an

Church of St. Thomas of Villanueva
(Miag-ao, Iloilo province)
Completed in 1797, this church is
one of the most lyrical, exuberant
examples of Philippine culture's
translation of Western baroque design
principles into a hybrid local style.
Constructed on a rise overlooking the
sea, the church originally served as a
fortress to protect the villagers from
pirate raids. Its basic architectural
composition follows the Philippine
archetype of a simply roofed, solid
and squat rectangular structure. A
pedimented façade was grafted onto
the front of the otherwise plain struc¬
ture. A pair of squat, non-symmetri¬
cal bell towers, which also once acted
as lookout towers to alert the villagers
in times of danger, taper upwards
from a square base. The two towers,
although of unequal height, provide
a strong upward thrust while visu¬
ally anchoring each side of the
façade. On the façade itself, heavily
incised relief carving with a remark¬
able three-dimensional quality
depicts St. Christopher dressed as a
Filipino farmer carrying the Christ-

These churches where Filipinos
still continue to worship illustrate
the success with which this culture

bridged East and West, forming a
distinctively recognizable, multi¬
cultural but nevertheless totally
Filipino identity. I
