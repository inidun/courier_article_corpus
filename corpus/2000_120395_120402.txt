Countering the previous viewpoint, the author turns to history to show that belief in the

Since the early 1980s, when the T h at c h e rite and
Reaganite revolutions were in full sw i n g, the doc-
t rine of neo-liberalism appears to have staked
itself out across the countries of the world without
meeting much serious opposition.But negat i ve reactions
to the spread of free market philosophy have ensued as
the damage it has caused — in terms of inequalities,
i m p ove ri s h m e n t , social exclusion and env i r o n m e n t a l
d e s t ruction—come to light.
S u p p o rt e rs of the free market advo c ate deregulat i o n
to the extent that all human activity would be run by the
p ri vate sector,while public authorities would be left to
manage the tools of coercion and law within a gi ven ter-
ri t o ry :n a m e l y, the army,the judicial system,and (if only
in part) the police and pri s o n s. On the other side, s u p-
p o rt e rs of a more humane economy, who have gr ow n
hugely in number over recent ye a rs , back a rather dif-
ferent formula for the good society:“ yes to the market
e c o n o my,not to the market society.” In other wo r d s ,t h e y
insist on the need to resurrect and re-establish regula-
tion in new and va ried forms so that it can cover today ’s
global dimensions of economic activity.
The differences between these two broad schools of
thought is at least three centuries old, b e ginning when
the old divine order— in which political authority wa s
enmeshed —collapsed.At the start of the 17th century,
Galileo confounded the Scriptures by proving that the
E a rth rotated around the Sun. S h o rtly after, p h i l o s o-
p h e rs such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke argued
t h at the social order was not grounded in Prov i d e n c e ,
but in the decisions of individuals.The medieval dogma
holding that all power came from God, who assigned
each person his or her “ n at u r a l ” place in society, wa s
s h at t e r e d .From then on, societies faced a new challenge:
d e fining the “social contract” t h at linked people with
each other and with the stat e .

Two radically opposed forms of contract were put
f o r wa r d .The first “ p o l i t i c a l ”f o rm placed its trust in the
good will of individuals, who could freely decide the
shape of the new social order.The second “ e c o n o m i c ”
option suspected that this trust in fa l l i b l e ,fickle human
n ature was open to abu s e .A new social order, these lat t e r
t h e o rists maintained,needed rock-solid foundat i o n s —
namely economic “ l aw s ,” which are “ n at u r a l ” and thus
u n c h a n gi n g .
The first such law is that eve ryone acts pri m a rily out
of his or her own personal interest, the main thrust of
which is a desire for ri c h e s. This impulse is shared
u n i ve rsally in all societies, the theory goes,and will eve n-
tually be the best method for organizing all of them.A s
a result, the market theory took its first step towards a
utopian vision in which eve rything is subjected to its
ru l e s.
It is false to claim, as many neo-liberals do, t h at
t o d ay ’s enhanced market ideology is essentially modern ,
and that the revival of tougher “ p o l i t i c a l ” r e g u l at o ry
mechanisms to check the supremacy of pri vate interests
over the public good would be a step backwa r d s.

Scottish economist Adam Smith outlined the funda-
mentals of the free market two centuries ago; r e g u l at i o n
came much lat e r.
In the 19th century, a number of ve ry tightly
controlled national and intern ational markets gave
way to a much more open market. The pendulum
swung again, h owe ve r , and as a result of the market’s
failure to deliver a wo r k a b l e , peaceful society, m a r k e t s
were refined so that they today include “ ru l e s ,i n s t i t u-
tions and networks that control and monitor the crea-
tion of supply and demand and the relationship bet-
ween them,” according to French economist Je a n
G a d r e y. But these interventions are now being chal-
lenged by a new wave of deregulat i o n . D e fining a
market economy, s ays Gadrey, has hence become an
“extremely contentious and political” issue—as well as
a ve ry urgent one.
A second flawed argument used by neo-liberals is
t h at the market economy is the only source of we a l t h ,
and in part i c u l a r , wealth for all (the notorious “ t ri c k l e -
d ow n ”t h e o ry ) .The past 20 ye a rs ,h owe ve r ,h ave testi-
fied to widening inequality,with the three richest people
n ow wielding a fortune gr e ater than the combined
GDP of the wo r l d ’s 48 poorest nat i o n s.
The third error committed by today ’s free-marke-
t e e rs is their denial of the fact that the real economy in
fact rests on three foundat i o n s , as the Hungari a n
é m i gré political scientist Karl Po l a nyi argued. In a
market economy, the terms of trade are fixed by pri c e s
t h at va rious participants in the markets decide upon on
the basis of their interests. But hidden in these calcu-
l ations are all sorts of non-market va riables and contri-
bu t i o n s ,s t a rting with gove rnment aid and subsidies to
firm s.
In the non-market economy, the distri bution of
goods and services is largely handled by the public
s e c t o r , which operates according to the rules set dow n
by democratically elected authori t i e s.This is the “ we l-
fare stat e .”But beyond this, in the third,n o n - m o n e t a ry
e c o n o my, the pri o rity rests on reciprocity, with ser-
vices distri buted by groups or people according to the
social links that bind them together, whether in fa m i-
l i e s ,a s s o c i ations or mutual support gr o u p s.
F i rms benefit from training and teaching conducted
in the home,and thus draw on a fund of “social capital.”
L i k e w i s e , in the expanding service sector,businesses take
a d vantage of intangible investments like educat i o n ,
which depends largely on the public sector, as well as
on orders and investments from public authori t i e s.
They also depend heavily on the political decisions
made by gove rn m e n t s.
These examples go to prove that neither the oft-
mentioned distinction between a market and non-
market economy nor the claim that the former is the
only source of wealth surv i ve critical examinat i o n .I n s-
t e a d , we should adopt a more realistic and less ideolo-
gically dri ven model: t h at of a plural economy. By put-
ting these va rious beliefs up for discussion, we can
escape the tyranny of a market conceived as an abstract
and impersonal norm imposed on eve ryo n e . To m o r-
r ow ’s humane economy can only be built through the
interaction of regulated markets, s t ates and democrat i c
civil societies. ■
