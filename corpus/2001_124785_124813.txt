To be heard 
and listened to

W orld events over the 
past few months 
have shown us that 
the efforts of those 
international organizations 
working for peace and dialogue 
between cultures are more 
important than ever.
From this perspective, the 
pertinence of U n esc o ’s pro-* 
grammes and the Organization’s 
defence of such values as edu­
cation for all, cultural diversity, 
press freedom or the eradica­
tion of poverty, is striking.
However, in the public eye, 
U nesco  is largely invisible and 
has been for a long time. This is 
not a question of vanity. On the 
contrary, a poor public image is 
a real handicap: U nesco has lit­
tle weight in the media and, by 
extension, in public debate. 
This is particularly worrying at a 
time when the world is crying 
out for some ethical signposts.
U nesco has chosen to face 
up to the problem by radically 
changing its information poli­
cies. In short, we have to reach 
out to all citizens, not just those 
committed to U nesco ’s cause. 
After all, the Organization’s con­
cerns and activities touch 
everybody’s lives in some way 
or another: the debate over 
human cloning, for example, or 
access to clean water, the digi­
tal divide, education, protection 
of our cultural and natural her­
itage, are of concern to us all, 
wherever we may live. It is 
U nesco ’s duty to fuel debate on 
these and other issues that fall 
under its mandate by providing
key data and analyses and by 
promoting the univeral values 
that the Organization stands 
for.
No organization today can 
fulfil such a goal without the 
support of the media: the news­
papers, magazines, radio and 
television programmes as well 
as the internet, which people 
read, listen to, watch and con­
sult daily.
To do this, U n e sco  must 
redeploy its staff members 
and redistribute its financial 
resources. It has therefore been 
decided to suspend publication 
of The U nesco  Courier—which 
had a larger budget than that of 
the World Heritage Center or 
the International Bureau of 
Education —in its current form 
at the end of the year. It will be 
replaced initially by a new 
Courier, which will come out 
twice a year (May and October) 
in the six official languages of 
the United Nations and distrib­
uted free of charge.
This marks a painful and 
inevitably controversial deci­
sion. Yet it should not be inter­
preted as the end of a long and 
often outstanding adventure. 
U nesco , with its new leadership 
firmly in place, is determined to 
be heard and listened to in a 
bid to become an indispens­
able reference in democratic 
debate.
