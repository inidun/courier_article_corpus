he natives of Lilliput in
Swift's Gullivei-'s Travels
stood knee high to a grass¬
hopper, measuring no more than six
inches in height, while the giant
Brobdingnagians were 60 feet tall.
Since then, modern Gullivers have
been exploring and measuring Lilli¬
putian worlds a million million times
smaller and giant Worlds many,
billions of times larger.
These figures stagger the imagi¬
nation. What, we may ask, can
man actually measure that is so
incredibly tiny, or so immense ?

others organized by Unesco, now touring
member states throughout the world.

At the smallest end of the scale of
measurement, exploring within the
atom, man has measured, the dia¬
meter of elementary particles such as
the proton. In the world of the
infinitely; great he has measured the
distance to the remotest galaxy ol
stars known today.
Nowadays, we know that many
animals have some knowledge of size
and distance. When a hermit crab,
for example, outgrows its shell
"hideout" and looks around for
a larger home, it prospects a new
shell by exploring it all over with its
claws and feelers. Only when it is
satisfied with the dimensions does it
"try on" the new shell for size.
But this is a confused sort of
knowledge. While there are many
kinds of animals capable of counting,
there is not one which has the idea
of measuring or of systematically
placing the living creatures and
things around it in their proper
relationship to one another.
It was when our ancestors learned
to measure things around them that
they Were better able to cope with
life. And they learned to measure
things as we do today by comparing
them with other lengths which they
took as standards or units. The first
such units were derived from things
with which man was most familiar:
the foot, the inch (from the thumb tip
to the. first joint), the cubit (derived

from the Latin cubilas, elbow, it was
the distance from a man's elbow to
the tip of his middle finger), and
others. The Egyptians used the
outstretched arms as a unit, and the
Greeks the length of a stadium (about
007 feet).
With his senses alone, man could
explore only a tiny fraction of the
universe. But, using his intellect, he
has designed and built tools and
instruments 'which have taken him
far beyond the world directly acces¬
sible to his senses. Willi their help
he has carried his investigations into
the realm both of the infinitely
small ' and of the infinitely large.
During his search for new know¬
ledge he has discovered unsuspected
marvels that have enriched his ideas
of the world, and in this process he
has developed new means with
which to transform his existence.
Exploring tiny specks
Until the 17lh century, when the
magnifying glass and the mi¬
croscope were invented, man
had practically no other instrument
for studying the infinitely small.
The lower limit of his universe was
the power of his own eye, i.e. its
capacity to distinguish two dots about
one-tenth of a millimetre (three,
thousandth's of an inch) apart, and
placed about ten inches from the
' eye.
With this human limitation it was
as if the entire world had been pass¬
ed through a sieve having a mesh of
one-tenth of a millimetre. Then,
suddenly, the new optical instruments
enabled man to peer into a mysterious
realm the "microscopic world"
and led him to the discovery of cells
and microbes, and thus to the proof
that-life also existed on this new and
tinier scale. With improvements in
the new research tools scientists
using the optical microscope even¬
tually were able to distinguish two
points 0.0001 mm apart the meshes
of the sieve had come a thousand
times closer together.
About two decades ago came ano¬
ther great advance the invention
of the electron microscope. With
this powerful instrument it was pos¬
sible to distinguish two points a mil¬
lionth of a millimetre apart. Thus
the meshes of the sieve had closed in
a further hundred times, and science
made a fine haul, bringing in viruses
the simplest form of life we know
and large organic molecules.
Then the discovery that X-rays' dif¬
fract (break up) on crystals brought
atoms into the microscopic instru¬
ment "net". Atoms were found to
be arranged in regular geometrical
patterns inside molecules, some ten
millionths of a millimetre apart. On
this level of the microscopic world
no form of life was found.
The achievement of measuring dis¬
tances between atoms in molecules
and crystals encouraged scientists to
accept the next challenge how to
measure the distances between the
particles which make up the atoms
themselves. Science and technology,
showing themselves equal to this
challenge, produced new instru¬
ments. One of these was the Wil¬
son Cloud chamber (a device which
makes it possible to see and photo¬
graph the path of electrically charged
particles). Another was the Geiger-
Muller counter which detects and
counts elementary particles emitted
by radio-active substances.
Now the meshes of the sieve had
become a million times more closely-
knit than before, catching elementary
particles electrons, protons and
.neutrons and giving man power¬
ful aid in his efforts to learn all the
basic secrets of matter.
Primitive man had a limited sense
of great distances. His life was.
taken up with the search for food.
For him major distances were those
which took him to the limits of his
hunting-ground. Bis life was a
two-dimensional one. Sometimes
he must have looked up at the night
sky to admire the stars, and wonder¬
ed how far a\vay they were. But
to know how distant an object is one
has to be able to reach it ; and primi¬
tive man's only means of reaching
skywards was to climb trees. He
therefore concluded that all heavenly^
bodies Were the same distance away,
from him.
This view prevailed until the 0th
century B.C. Then the Ancient
Greeks made two important measure-
ments: the circumference of the
Earth and .the distance from the Earth
to the Moon. Their other measure¬
ments, however, were little more than
imaginative inventions. It was Co¬
pernicus in the 10th century who first
worked out the exact order of distri¬
bution and distances of the main pla¬
nets.
Reaching for the stars
The invention of the telescope, in
1 the 17th century, gave man a
powerful instrument to reach
beyond the limits of this visual
capacity. Until then, astronomers
had only studied the planetary
system. But with the 18th century,
scientists began to take an active
interest in the stars, and devised
techniques and instruments for
measuring their dimensions and dis¬
tances method of trigono¬
metric parallaxes, the spectrophoto-
metric method and others. In 1838,
just over a hundred years ago, the
first stellar distance was measured
that of Star 01 from Cygnus (11

Messages from
outer space
High on the flat top of Mount Palomar
in southern California stands the world's
largest telescope with a mirror over 16
feet in diameter (above). It can penetrate
interstellar space 500 million to a thousand
million light years away. Science is now
developing another and more extensive
" window " into outer space by capturing
radio waves transmitted by the stars with
a new instrument, the radio telescope,
which uses large radar aerials shaped like
concave mirrors. It is unhampered by
climatic conditions, operating day or night,
and has revealed previously unsuspected
radio stars which may well be as common
in the universe as visible stars. Britain
is completing a giant 250 foot radio tele-
cope, to be the world's largest (model is
shown on left). Remarkable photo on right
is the " Dumbbell " planetary nebula, a
luminous cluster of stars 650 light years
away (3,815 million million miles), taken
by French observatory.

light-years) Distances were at that
time measured in thousands of mil¬
liards of kilometres
Since then, instruments have been
steadily improved. ' Attention was
turned from individual stars to gal¬
axies. At the beginning of the 20th
century, the distances measured
were no further than a hundred light-
years or so ; but the largest telescope
in the world today (on Mount Palo¬
mar in the United States) with its
5-metre mirror, enables scientists to
observe galaxies nearly a thousand
million light-
years a\vay.
Measurement of

nitely small and infinitely large
universe of ever receeding limits.
Our present knowledge in this field
is shown in.a Unesco travelling scien¬
tific exhibition " Man Measures the
Universe", which is now touring the
countries of Western Europe., t
The exhibition explains nine ma¬
jor scales of magnitude and employs
a large collection of scientific instru¬
ments to demonstrate methods of
measurement used in each case.
They cover the entire range of size
beginning with lengths that are near
the human scale
and measured in
yards, feet and
inches, then
downward to the
smallest known
dimensions of the
particles inside
the atom.
