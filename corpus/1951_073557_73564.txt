A WORLD CRUSADE
SWEEPING TH E CO 
OUT OF OUR MU

A TOWN I know is proud of itsschools, colleges and teachers'
training institutions. Yet in
its museum, which should be such
an important part of the educational
system, it takes little pride. Housed
in a dark and unattractive-looking
building, the museum is open to the
public twice a week, yet most people
use it as a means of passing dull
Sunday afternoons in winter.
The museum does not lack exhi-
bits ; on the contrary, it overflows
with masterpieces representing three
centuries of craftsmanship, a fine na-
tural history collection bequeathed
by an old scholar, African and Chin-
ese art treasures brought back by
an explorer of former times, and
canvasses and drawings by 17th and
18th century masters-all mixed
up in dusty rooms, inaccessible and
useless.
Meanwhile, in the schools and col-
leges, teachers wish they could show
their pupils real works of art, masks,
vases and authentic ivories ; they
would like to have samples of rock
for the geology lectures, stone tools
for history lessons. All these things
are to be found in the local museum
- along with many other treasures
- but the teachers will perhaps
never know this.
Thousands of towns, although pro-
vided with museums, are yet depriv-
ed of them in this way, for those
which aim to attract the public are
still rare, except possibly in the
United States.
It is true that hardly a hundred
years ago even the most famous
museums were content simply to
amass and then jealously guard
treasures from all lands, but they
have since made enormous progress
as science in general has come to
realize its social responsibilities.
Only the most modern, in certain
large cities have, however, managed
to adapt themselves to perform a
truly educational mission among
people of all ages and cultures.
All Can Help
A PARIS professor has declared thathe would not know how"to
give his pupils a satisfactory cultural
background with an insight into the
lessons of the past supplemented by
a proper technical education", with-
out taking them on carefully-
prepared visits to art, science and
history museums.
"Let us hope for an increase in
the number of museums like the
Palais de la Decouverte, the Musée
de 1'Homtne and the Musée des Co-
lonies", he says."These, in my
opinion, represent the prototype of
the modern museum".
All museums, no matter what
their origins or specialities, can
serve education and collaborate more
and more actively with schools.
Those who run them are no longer
simply"curators"and they would
undoubtedly agree with one of their
predecessors, Sir Henry Cole, who
wrote what in 1874 was then a bold
statement :
"If you wish your schools of
science and art to be effective, your
health, the air, and your food to be
wholesome, your life to be long, your
manufactures to improve, and your
people to be civilized, you must have
museums of science and art to illus-
trate the principles of life, health,
Sorcery ? No, just one of the striking demonstrations in physics which
children can see at the Palais de la Decouverte, in Paris. Here, they find
living illustrations of what they have learned in their books and lessons.

dents find magnifi-
cently real and
living illustrations
of what they have
learned in their
books and lessons".
He adds :"It may
be that when a
young man comes
to realize the beauty
of science and its
role in the future
of man, he will de-
cide to concentrate
his efforts and
perhaps his whole
life to it". Nume-

have declared that
apparently mediocre
classes are amaz-
ingly transformed

nature, science, art and beauty".
Such museums must indeed be set
up, and luckily the models exist.
The Paris professor referred to
above picked out as his preference
among the"prototypes"the Palais
de la Decouverte. This was founded
in 1937, and has become one of the
world's finest examples in scientific
museology.
All who visit the Palais do not
come out with a bent for astronomy
or medicine. But in the words of
the well-known scientist Louis de
Broglie :"Schoolchildren and stu-
An International Plan
IT was in the Palais-or at leastin the offic  of M. André Leveille,
its director-that the"Museums
Crusade"was started. A prelimi-
nary meeting of teachers had recog-
nized that the ideas and methods
used in his museum should be made
available to all France's schools and
colleges and that a plan to enable
all museums to participate actively
in educational programmes be
drawn up.
But this is not meant only for
France. From the beginning, the
leaders of the Crusade conceived it
as an international one ; and, with
this aim in, mind, they approached
Unesco.
As a result the American Museum
Association is undertaking the same
programme as the Paris museums.
Its leaders are soon to meet some of
their European colleagues to study
the best ways to reach their common
goal-the widest collaboration bet-
ween museums and schools.
In the Netherlands, the Ministry
of Education has ordered a special
commission to study how museum
resources can be put more fully at
the disposal of youth and the people
generally. These meetings, inquiries
and studies are being followed close-
ly by Unesco.
Meanwhile, the Crusade is gather-
ing momentum. Unesco hopes soon
to bring together at an international
seminar, museum experts, educators,
artists and scientists who can help
extend this scheme to many other
countries.
It is thanks to such a crusade that
the most humble museums, as well
as the richest, can render the service
they owe to the community.
No longer will there be museums
whose collections of useless bric-à-
brac slowly waste away in deserted
show cases. Instead, students, teach-
ers and apprentices will go freely
there at any hour of the day, alone
or in groups, to find the indispens-
able concrete examples and tangible
proofs.
