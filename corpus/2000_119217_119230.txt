L ike all of El Salva d o r ’s institutions, t h e
school system suffered from the effects of
the bloody civil war that ravaged the country
between 1980 and 1992. When the war came to
an end, half a million children, most of them in
rural areas, were illiterat e , and a shortage of
teachers meant they had little chance of going to
s c h o o l . The war caused $2,125,000 wo rth of
damage to the educational infrastru c t u r e ,
according to a government report.
Backed by officials from the educat i o n
m i n i s t ry (MINED), parents in some of the
poorest villages decided to act, and in 1991 the
EDUCO Community-Based Educat i o n
P r o gramme programme was launched. L o c a l
self-management of schools was a new concept
for Latin America.
Pa re n t - d i re c t o rs control 
the purse strings
EDUCO enabled parents to take part in
running schools, from hiring teachers to pay i n g
their salaries. The parents—farmers and manual
labourers—soon began to draw up plans and to
use the money transferred to them by the
ministry to pay teachers and running costs.
At Los Izotes, a village 35 km north of the
c a p i t a l , San Salva d o r , 260 children gather each
day in a small building surrounded by trees and
painted blue and white, El Salva d o r ’s nat i o n a l
colours. Their school has the same timetable, the
same equipment and the same lessons as any
other in the country. Unlike most Salva d o ri a n
schools, however, it is run by local people.
EDUCO was first tried out here and in five
other villages in very poor and inaccessible areas
before being extended to the rest of the country
and becoming the centrepiece of the
government’s education strategy. The number of
children attending such locally-run schools rose
from 8,400 in 1991 to more than 237,000 in
1999, according to MINED.
Each of the schools is managed by a
community education association (AC E ) , w h o s e
m e m b e rs are parents elected at a general
a s s e m b l y. This allows courses to be
decentral ized and the administration to be
s t r e a m l i n e d . According to MINED, 1,722 AC E s
were operating nationwide in 1999, with more
than 4,700 teachers.
At Los Izotes the school population has
increased, especially since the children no longer
had to make the long journey to attend school in
the nearest city, Q u e z a l t e p e q u e . To meet the
gr owing demand, the families asked the
government to build new premises in the village.
“MINED asked us to look for a building that
could house a temporary school while the new
one was going up on a plot donated by a local
landowner,” says Jorge Alberto Molina, president
of the Los Izotes ACE.
M o l i n a , a 34-year-old father of five boy s ,
s ays that after several months’ wo r k , the new
building was opened in May 1999 and that this
year it is expected to receive 300 children, f r o m
i n fants to seventh gr a d e . The children are visibly
happy about having a school to go to. “ We really
want our new school, and it’s near to where we
l i ve so we can help our parents at home or in the
fie l d s ,” s ays 11-year-old Victor Va l e n c i a , who is
in sixth gr a d e .
At the end of each month, the teachers , who are
on yearly contracts, make out a bill and the directors
of the ACE pay their salaries and send the staff ’s
c o n t ri butions to the national social security and pen-
sion authori t i e s. As in any pri vate firm , the parent-
d i r e c t o rs are allowed to make pay deductions if a
teacher is absent without a good reason.
At the end of the ye a r , the ACE directors
assess the teachers’ work and decide whether or
not to renew their contracts. Te a c h e rs in the
EDUCO programme earn 3,485 colons ($400)
and if they work double shifts (morning and
afternoon), they get $514.
Stirring intere s t
in other countries
A 1997 MINED study, backed by the Wo r l d
B a n k , found that although children attending these
schools were socially and economically wo rse off than
those at traditional schools, the rate of academic suc-
cess in both kinds of schools was about the same. B u t
some in the stat e - run education sector criticize the
EDUCO schools. Jesus Rive r a ,s e c r e t a ry-general of
the National A s s o c i ation of Salvadoran Te a c h e rs ,

gramme “ d e p ri ves teachers of many of their ri g h t s ,
i n c l u d i n g the right to form a trade union.And since
the contracts are renewed on a yearly basis, the tea-
chers have no job security at all.”
Despite the criticism, the World Bank praised
EDUCO in 1997 as a “flagship programme.” In
the almost 10 years it has been going, EDUCO
has also stirred interest in other countri e s.
Missions have come from Brazil, M e x i c o,
G u at e m a l a , H o n d u r a s , Costa Rica, Pa n a m a ,
Uganda, Senegal and a dozen other countries to
have a look at El Salvador’s experiment.
The 1997 study noted that EDUCO “has been
remarkably successful in expanding educat i o n a l
o p p o rtunities for the poor in rural areas.” S a n t i a g o
M i r a n d a , a member of the Los Izotes AC E ,e m p h a-
tically agrees and say s : “EDUCO has brought us
d e velopment and gi ven us the means to carry out
other projects, such as building a road. Before that ,
no vehicles could get here. We also dug a well to
p r ovide water for the school.Then we got electri c i t y
and now we ’ ve even got phones in our village.” ■

Parents meet to discuss the running of the local school at Los Izotes, one of the first villages to take part 
in El Salvador’s community-based education programme.
