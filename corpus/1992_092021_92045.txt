ROUGHTS and floods in
1987 in India, Africa, Aus¬
tralia, Indonesia, North
and SouthAmerica and the
Philippines were caused by
the El Niño effect. El Niño
is the name given to the
recurring tropical pheno¬
menon that brings a warm current
to the west coast of South America
every three to five years. It begins to
appear around Christmas-time, as
befits its name (EI Niño means the
Christ-child in Spanish).

During El Niño periods the warm
ocean surface temperatures, nor¬
mally found only in the western
Pacific, move east toward the cen¬
tral Pacific and the western coast
of South America. The results are
unusual weather and short-term
climatic changes. There have been
crop losses and famines as well as
major changes in fisheries such as
severe reductions in the Peruvian
anchovy catches, and tropical crus¬
taceans have moved far north of
their normal habitats.
Oceans cover 70 per cent of the
Earth's surface, and contain 97 per
cent of the world's water. They have
long been understood to influence
weather patterns, including hurri¬
canes, typhoons and tropical
storms. Only recently, however, has
their very large influence on clima¬
tic variability and climatic change
become accepted. The interaction
between oceans, atmospheric acti¬
vity, weather and climate are be¬
coming better understood.
Oceans absorb and retain heat,
as well as carbon dioxide (which
could theoretically help to mitigate
the effects ofglobal warming). The
top two metres ofocean contain as
much heat as the atmosphere, but
the average ocean temperature
ranges from 2°C (its freezing tem¬
perature) to 30°C, in contrast to
mid-continent variations of up to
100 degrees of difference.
Changes in ocean temperatures
and currents and in salinity levels
can affect weather and climate,

which in turn determine which
crops will (or will not) grow in a
given season and which fish will
be found (or not found) in a
given marine, coastal or estuarine
environment.
Raised sea water temperatures
already have affected coastal zones
in many regions. Changes in
nutrient levels and water tempera¬
ture have caused mass mortality of
corals; decreases in sediment inputs
lead to the retreat of mangroves.
While these incidents occur as a
result of locally or regionally im¬
posed burdens, they suggest what
might occur with global influences.
Although oceans might reduce the
effects of global climatic change,
they also could make matters worse;
increases in ocean surface water
temperature can cause a release of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Moreover, as oceans absorb carbon
dioxide their acidity increases, which
in turn lowers their ability to take
up further carbon dioxide.
If climatic change or other phe¬
nomena were to cause a rise in sea-
level ofbetween 20 centimetres and
a metre, a number of problems
might result. There are thousands of
populated islands at low altitude in
the world's oceans, and many major
cities are located in low-lying areas
ofcontinental coastlines; they could
suffer flooding or inundation. Glob¬
al sea levels have already risen in
some areas, by approximately 15
centimetres, over the past century.
Among the reasons given are land
movements and tectonic plate acti¬
vity, local océanographie and
meteorological conditions and
numerous human activities on land.
In some cases, however, land has
actually risen.
To improve human understanding
of the oceans requires the applica¬
tion ofmany disciplines and many
technologies. Satellite imaging is
identifying currents and tempera¬
ture gradients. The International

throughout the world by Unesco's
Intergovernmental Océanographie
Commission (IOC), the United
Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) and the U.S. National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Admi¬
nistration, is gathering extremely
useful data. Mussels are, in effect, an
"indicator" species capable of
revealing everything from the level
of pesticides applied on upland
agricultural lands to the presence of
other toxins.
A new international effort has
begun to monitor, describe and
understand the physical and bio-
geochemical properties that deter¬
mine ocean circulation and the sea¬
sonal-to-decadal climatic changes
in the ocean and to provide the
extensive observations which will
be needed for any climatic predic¬
tions. Known as the Global Ocean
Observing System (GOOS), it is
jointly sponsored by IOC, the World
Meteorological Organization
(WMO), UNEP and the states
concerned.
In the past dozen years, intensive
scientific research jointly sponsored
by IOC, WMO, the International
Council ofScientific Unions (ICSU)
and the Scientific Committee on
Oceanic Research (SCOR) has great¬
ly increased the understanding ofEl
Niño. Known as the Study ofTropi¬
cal Oceans and Global Atmosphere
(TOGA), its observers- have begun
to piece together enough informa¬
tion to begin anticipating El Nino's
arrival and its expected effects.
El Niño is, of course, only one
phenomenon among many in the
highly complex and poorly under¬
stood system ofoceans, atmosphere,
weather and climate. To compre¬
hend potential global climatic
change, much more information
than now existswill be needed.
