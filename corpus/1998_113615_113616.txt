“The Taliban are nothing but extremists,
soldiers who impose their will on the people
by force,”he said.“They are savages who do
not consider women human beings and have
relegated them to the rank of animals.” Dr.

some misfortune I had a daughter, w h at kind

taken away. “Before the

“I was a medical student,

S e ated beside Shaima is her mother,M a r
Gul.A school principle until 1996,she says,
“Our life has become a prison and my
d a u g h t e r ’s future will amount to wa s h i n g

Women do not exist.To the Taliban,all they
are good for is having babies.”

talking a little about us.”
