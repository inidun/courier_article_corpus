e x p l o i t at i o n .And it is difficult to see how these changes
can be reve rs e d .
In the hope of increasing foreign reve n u e ,t h e
H i m a l ayan gove rnments are continuing to open
new areas to tourism each ye a r , generally without
p r o p e r l y - d e veloped management plans or any idea
of carrying capacity. Since the mid-1990s, India has
opened parts of A runachal Pradesh and new areas of
Himachal Pradesh. Nepal has permitted cross-
border trekking to Tibet on its nort h west frontier
and allowed freer access to its peripheral Buddhist
k i n g d o m s. Bhutan is the only country in the regi o n
t h at has opted for a quota system, which is in fa c t
seldom fil l e d . In a sign of further opening to foreign
v i s i t o rs , the gove rnment of Bhutan has increased
p ri vate-sector part i c i p ation in the industry, w h i l e
maintaining strict control over the sector.
In Nepal, the rapid gr owth of trekking tourism has
resulted in better internal air serv i c e s , the opening of
new local airp o rts and the building of roads, gi v i n g
large numbers of visitors access to monasteries and
r e l i gious sites in ve ry remote areas of the country.A
well-heeled traveller wishing to visit the Khumbu
or Mustang areas of Himalayan Nepal, for example,
can now charter a helicopter to do so, reducing his tra-
velling time from several weeks to a few hours. B u t
h owe ver they are reached, the demand to visit Bud-
dhist monastic sites, and in part i c u l a r , to at t e n d
masked dance festiva l s , is on the ri s e , reinforced by
constant media attention in the We s t , from television
d o c u m e n t a ries to adve rtising commercials.
Such festiva l s , generally held on dates determ i n e d
by the Tibetan lunar calendar,usually last for seve r a l
d ays and typically include at least one day of masked
ritual dances commemorating specific religious eve n t s
and performed in the monastery court yard by monks.

1 People and tourism
Once a region that chiefly attracted inve t e r at e
t r e k k e rs and climbers , the Himalayas are now
d r awing an increasing number of visitors who
place a high premium on personal enrichment through
contact with other cultures,a trend that is not without
m i rr o ring Buddhism’s gr owing appeal in the we s t .
Such journeys might invo l ve visiting religious sites,
attending festivals or gaining a better unders t a n d i n g
of the workings of Himalayan communities.
To dat e , the impact of intern ational tourism on the
r e gion has chiefly focused on environmental issues,
such as deforestation and pollution, which tend to be
more outwardly visible than the effects on local socie-
ties and their cultures. But as tourism to the regi o n
continues to gr ow—it has doubled over the past ten
ye a rs to an annual two-and-a-half million visitors — t e n-
sions are beginning to emerge between the confli c t i n g
aims of intern ational visitors and host communities,
p a rticularly at the mainly Buddhist Himalayan monas-
t e ri e s , temples and festiva l s.
Once a major force in keeping isolated commu-
nities together, these festiva l s ,c h a r a c t e rized by spec-
tacular masked dances, h ave in many cases become
cultural products for sale to touri s t s. In recent ye a rs ,
their popularity has often resulted in modific ation of
traditional practices, decreased local interest and

coincide with the festiva l s.The easier the monastery
is to reach,the more visitors will come, which increases
the likelihood that their presence will alter the festiva l
in some way.Typical problems include inconsiderat e
p h o t o gr a p hy and local people being crowded out by
v i s i t o rs , although this is sometimes encouraged by
monastic authorities who exploit the chance to make
a little money. Selling tickets to tourists and ensuri n g
t h at they get pri o rity seating can generate much-
needed curr e n cy but also cause local resentment.
E ven the structure of the festivals can be altered as a
r e s u l t , sometimes by programme changes where
dances are shortened to accommodate we s t e rn e r ’s low
boredom thresholds. Another unwelcome by-pro-
duct has been the escalation of a black market in reli-
gious art work (particularly in small, p o rtable stat u e s
and t h a n k a s ( r e l i gious paintings on silk) and at least one
m o n a s t e ry on the tourist beat has had to use its tou-
rism revenues to install security screening.
A tourist-driven religious revival
It is not just the Buddhist festivals that at t r a c t
v i s i t o rs. In lowland areas of Nepal,Hindu festivals and
masked Hindu dances at Bhaktapur also draw touri s t s ,
most of whom will combine such a trip with visits to
the World Heritage sites of the Kathmandu va l l e y. I n
the we s t e rn Himalayan kingdom of Ladakh, m o s t
people are Mahayana Buddhists with beliefs consis-
ting of a mixture of Ta n t ric and animistic pre-Buddhist
Bon influ e n c e s.Their festivals take place in the bleak
winter months when villagers gather together. S t a l l s
and a market develop around the go m p a s ( f o rt r e s s
m o n a s t e ri e s ) , highlighting the festiva l ’s role in uniting
s c attered communities, and masked dances are also
p e r f o rm e d .While such events have been visited by we s-
t e rn e rs for many ye a rs , a more recent development is
the “ Fe s t i val of Ladakh”held during the first week of
August and organized by the tourist office rather than
monastic authori t i e s , purely to attract visitors.
In Bhutan the state religion is the Drukpa Kagyupa
school of  Ta n t ric Buddhism with around 5,000 monks
a c c o m m o d ated in fort r e s s - m o n a s t e ries call d zo n g s
t h at form the kingpin of all tourist itinerari e s.T h e i r
annual masked dance festivals (t s e c h u) are the only time
v i s i t o rs may enter many of the d zo n g s.A few ye a rs ago,
s e veral of the monasteries were placed off-limits after
complaints over abu s i ve photogr a p hy.The effect on the
Bhutanese tourism industry was so severe that most
h ave now re-opened.The dates and locations of fes-
t i vals are now available on the WWW and tours may
be booked via the intern e t .
While the incident points to a gr owing depen-
dence on tourist reve n u e , in some cases, i n c r e a s e d
p r o s p e rity as a result of tourism has led to no less than
a religious reviva l .Tengboche monastery in the Solu
area of the Sherpa country in Nepal is now a pri m e
t o u rist destinat i o n , housing an active community of
over 40 monks.Yet the monastery was almost desert e d
in the 1970s when the monks left to work in trekking
t o u ri s m , and destroyed by fire in 1988. M a s k e d
dances were only introduced here in 1942 but are
n ow seen annually by hundreds of touri s t s — m o r e
than 80 per cent of the audience may be foreign—pro-
ducing revenue to keep the monastery going and
expand its activities, which now include a solar-
h e ated lodge and helicopter landing pad. C h a r gi n g
v i s i t o rs for admission either to monasteries or to
masked dances may also generate funding for essen-
tial replacement and repairs to costumes and masks,
as well as for monastic education progr a m m e s.
But local complaints about the bad behaviour of
v i s i t o rs to sacred sites are increasingly common, and it
seems possible that a tolerance threshold has been
r e a c h e d . Some tour operat o rs have started to publish
booklets about festiva l s , d e s c ribing the rituals and
giving visitors tips on etiquette, such as where to stand,
and when and when not to take photos.As tourism to
the region increases—in areas not controlled by a
quota system,annual increases of 10 to 20 per cent can
be anticipat e d — v i s i t o rs must learn to better align their
e x p e c t ations and behaviour with those of local com-
m u n i t i e s. Not doing so can produce resentment—
