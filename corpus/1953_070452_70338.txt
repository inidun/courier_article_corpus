THE RACE QUESTION IN
MODERN SCIENCE (Series)
Each volume : $. 25 ; 1/6 ; 75 frs.
* Racial Myths, by Juan Comas.
The author traces the originsof racialism and its evolution
throughout the centuries., and
shows that such manifestations
take root whenever individual
and collective security appear
to be menaced. The myths of
blood superiority and of the
racial inferiority of the Jews,
coloured peoples and hybrids
are analvsed and exposed.
* Race and Biology, by L. C. Dunn.
In this booklet, the author
shows by scientific analysis
that the old views of fixed and
absolute biological differences
are without scientific justi-
fication. The operation of
heredity clearly proves that in
the human species there is no
such thing as a pure race in the
sense of one in which all
members are alike.
* Race and Culture, by Michel
Leiris.
Within the framework of
three principal sections :"Scope
and concept of race","Man and
his cultures"and"There is no
inborn racial aversion", the
author undertakes an objective
analysis of the ways in which
racial prejudice was able to
become established and to
spread for reasons that are
essentially economic and social.
* Race and Psychology, by otto
Klineberg,
By submitting examples of
the kinds of psychological tests
given to different racial groups,
and giving the reasons for their
validity or non-validity, the
author shows that the net
result of all the research con-
ducted in this field is to the
effect that innate racial differ-
ences in intelligence have not
been demonstrated. The re-
lation of physique to mentality,
the effects of race mixtures,
differences in personality and
temperament are among the
other subjects here discussed.
* The Roots of Prejudice, by Arnold
M. Rose.
An objective analysis of the
causes and effects of prejudice,
with suggestions for action to
reduce its presence in in-
dividuals or groups. The au-
thor analyses as some of the
causes of prejudice : apparent
personal advantages to be
gained thereby ; ignorance of
other groups ; and the"su-
peri<Jrity complex". He dis-
cusses also the transmission of
prejudice to children, the
psychology of prejudice, and
prejudice as a warping of the
nl'rsonaJitv.
* Race and History, by Claude Level-
Strauss.
The contributions made by
various races of men to world
civilizations constitute the cen-
tral theme of this publication.
The question of the alleged
superiority of the white man's
civilization is studied in detail ;
emphasis is placed on the
danger of evaluating cultural
institutions on a purely evo-
lutionarv basis.
* The Significance of Racial Dif-
ferences, by G. M. Morant.
Human populations differ in
mentality and behaviour ; the
problem is to discover why this
is so. In this study, the author
takes up the controversial
question of deciding how far
the observed differences are
due to essential differences in
quality, and how far they can
be attributed to modifying con-
ditions of life. His conclusion
is that although differences in
mental characters are more
difficult to define and assess
than physical differences-and
conclusions for these are hence
uncertain-it is unrealistic to
deny the existence of such
differences. However, their sig-
nificance appears to be pro-
gressively reduced as knowledge
increases.
* Race and Society, by Kenneth L.
Little.
A review of the contrasting
attitudes towards race as ma-
nifested by different national
groups, with particular em-
phasis on the racial question in
England. The author's con-
tention is that race prejudice
and its effects will diminish
only after profound economic
and political changes have
taken place.
* The Race Concept (Results of an
Inquiry).
Since the appearance in 195U
of the first Unesco"Statement
on Race"and the second
"Statement on the Nature of
Race and Racial Differences",
drawn up in 1951, much interest
has been shown, and many
questions raised, with regard to
Unesco's race programme. The
Race Concept c 1 ear 1 y and
frankly discusses the genesis,
development and controversies
surrounding Unesco's parti-
cipation in the campaign
against race prejudice and
gives the reader an intimate
glimpse into the problems that
confronted Unesco in issuing a

AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1953. page 19
Statement that would reflect
accurately the views of scien-
tific circles. By printing, with
the text of the Statement, all
the comments by anthro-
pologists and geneticists to
which it has given rise, Unesco
hopes to enable the general
public to appreciate the fluc-
tuations of scientific thought
on on the problem of race.
* Race Mixture, by Harry L. Shapiro
(in preparation).
The well-known author of
"The Heritage of the Bounty"
examines race mixtures in
various parts of the world and
shows that they have no ill
effects and also that hybrid
groups are often characterized
by beauty and vigour. (See
article on pages
6-7).

RACES AND SOCIETY
(Series)
Race and Class in Rural Brazil,
edited by Charles Wagley ; pho-
tographs by Pierre Verger.
Price : $1. 25 ; 7/6 ; 350 fr.
This publication is the result
of a research project on the
subject of race relations in
Brazil undertaken by Unesco.
As the title indicates, it is a
s t u d y of the relationships
between social classes in the
rural scene as well as of race
relations under rural con-
ditions. (Over 70% of Brazil's
people live in small towns of
less than 5, 000 people, or in the
countryside). Each of the
communities dealt with is rep-
resentative of a different re-
gion of rural Brazil.
THE RACE QUESTION IN
MODERN THOUGHT
(Series)
The Catholic Church and the Race
Question, by Father Yves Congar.
Price : $. 40 ; 2/- ; 100 frs.
Here, the race question in
relation to Catholic dogma is
reviewed by an eminent Ca-
tholic theologian. Father Con-
gar sets forth the position of
the Catholic Church in the
problem from the spiritual, the
social and the historical points
of view. He shows that the
principles of Catholicism are
profoundly opposed to racial
discrimination, and that the
Church has courageously op-
posed"racialism"during the
recent persecutions. (See arti-
cle by Father Congar on page
8.)
* Jewish Thought as a Factor in
Civilization, by Professor Leon
Roth (in preparation).
The author, a philosopher
and historian, examines the
contribution of Judaism to the
values which form the basis of
our civilization. He refutes the
accusation of"racialism"so
often levelled against the Jews,
by producing evidence of every-
thing in Judaism that is the
very negation of racial ex-
clusivity, and he also em-
phasizes the extent of the debt
we owe to Jewish thought and
its part in the formation of
Western civilization.
* The Ecumenical Movement and
the Race Question, by W. A.
Visser't Hooft (in preparation).
me autnor or tillS DOOKlet
(title subject to change) is the
General-Secretary of the World
Council of Churches. He ex-
amines from a theological point
of view the position of the
churches and in particular the
Calvinist church in relation to
the race problems of our time.
(See article by the author on
page 9,)
* The Teacher Was Black (A
Unesco sponsored publication) by
H. E. O. James and Cora Tenen.
The subject of this book is an
experiment in international un-
derstanding sponsored by
Unesco. It describes the re-
actions of children in an English
school to people from other
lands who came to their town
during and after the war, and
before and after these children
had been taught by two Negro
teachers from Nigeria. Before
they had had this experience
the children thought of other
races in the generally distorted
fashion they had learned from
comics, films and propaganda.
When they actually met the
Negro teachers their ideas were
modified as well as their whole
attitude to other peoples.
