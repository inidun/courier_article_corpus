The changing pattern
of Chinese agriculture
by Ma Shiyu
WITH her vast territory (9,560,500
square kilometres) and enor¬
mous human resources, China
has a long tradition of intensive farming.
More than 800 million of her total popula¬
tion of over one billion work on the land,
and this abundance of labour has meant
that mechanization of agriculture has pro¬
ceeded- cautiously.
In recent years new trends have emerged.
New rural policies adopted in 1979 have
resulted in modernization based on diver¬
sified development of agriculture, animal
husbandry, fisheries and sideline enter¬
prises which produce basic goods such as
bricks, bottles and low-cost clothing and
employ about 30 million rural workers.
Perhaps the most important change has
been the introduction of the "responsibility

system" which has led to a remarkable in¬
crease in farm productivity, even in regions
where agriculture is most backward, and
the last three years have been notable for
bumper harvests.
In the past, the method of sharing out the
fruits of the harvest caused dissatisfaction
among the peasants who felt that their
labour was not being fairly rewarded; pro¬
ductivity remained stagnant or even
decreased.
Under the new responsibility system each
farm household contracts to farm a certain
area of land and to deliver a part of the crop
to the State and to the commune, keeping
whatever they grow above the quota. This
means that each farming household is free
to manage its work itself and to assume sole
responsibility for its profits or losses. At the
same time land and the means of produc¬
tion remain the property of the collective
body.
The new system is already evolving.
Agricultural co-operatives have been
established which handle specialized pro¬
duction, such as raising ducks or fish, or
offer specialized services, such as sugar re¬
fining and transport services.
Never before have so many Chinese
peasants had so much money. Today, more
than 60 per cent of all the nation's cash is
circulating in the countryside. By the end of
1982, peasant families had 28.2 billion yuan
($15.2 billion) on deposit in banks, an
average of more than 30 yuan for every
man, woman and child in the rural areas.
To this must be added the 32.3 billion yuan
deposited by rural collectives, factories and
enterprises, making a total in rural banks of
60.5 billion. Five years ago it was only 25
billion.
According to preliminary figures released
by the State Statistical Bureau, the cash in¬
come of peasants increased at an average
15

annual rate of 19.4 billion yuan in the four
years 1979 to 1982. This is 6.9 times the
average annual increase for the twenty-six
years 1952 to 1978.
A survey of 18,000 peasant households in
twenty-six provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions showed that the
number of families with an annual per
capita income exceeding 300 yuan grew
from 2.4 per cent in 1978 to 22.6 per cent in
1981 , the most well-off families being those
with special skillsraising chickens, ducks,
fish or bees, or cultivating marketable
herbs. The proportion of poor families with
an annual per capita income below 100
yuan dropped from 33.3 per cent in 1978 to
4.7 per cent in 1981.
Chinese peasants spent 148 billion yuan
on capital and consumer goods and
building materials in 1982. This was an 1 1 .8
per cent increase over 1981 and 82.6 per
cent over 1978.
As the purchasing power of farming
families increases, the demand for in¬
dustrial products becomes greater and
greater. Farm tools and equipment and
other aids to production are the first priori¬
ty, followed by materials for building and
repairing houses, with consumer goods
third.
Under the responsibility system there has
been a change in the pattern of mechaniza¬
tion with a decrease in demand for large and
medium-size farming equipment and an in¬
crease in purchases of small, semi-
mechanized equipment such as 3 to 8
horsepower compact tractors, processing
machines, pumps, swathers, windrowers
and wheelbarrows. Not only are these
small-size machines and implements
cheaper to buy and easier to maintain and
operate, they also adapt more easily than
larger equipment to the varying natural
conditions throughout the country and are
more in keeping with the size of the
household production unit and with the
present technical, economic and cultural
level of the Chinese rural worker.
Chinese peasant families now eat more
rice and wheat than coarse grains and this
change in their traditional diet is a clear in¬
dication of their improved standard of

living. According to the State Statistical
Bureau survey grain consumption per
capita reached 256 kilograms in 1981, with
rice and wheat accounting for 67 per cent as
against 49 per cent in 1978, the remainder
being made up of corn, sorghum, millet and
other coarse grains.
The survey also shows an increase in pro¬
tein intake among rural families. In 1981
per capita daily protein intake was 66.82
grammes, 4 per cent higher than in 1978.
Average annual consumption of pork, ed¬
ible oils, poultry, eggs and fish all increased
and many peasant families are now raising
chickens and ducks for family consumption
and sale.
The cost of living in the countryside is
lower than in the cities. The majority of
rural families own the houses they live in
and do not have the burden of rent; they
produce virtually all the vegetables, meat
and poultry they need and a peasant family
with a per capita annual income of 200 yuan
is therefore considered to be tolerably well-
off.

Arable land: Land under temporary crops, temporary meadows, land under market and kitchen
gardens, and land temporarily fallow or lying idle.
Land under permanent crops refers to land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long
periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, coffee and rubber. It in¬
cludes land under shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees and vines, but excludes land under trees grown
for wood or timber.
