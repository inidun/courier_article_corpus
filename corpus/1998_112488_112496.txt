Four ye a rs after the fall of apart h e i d ,S o u t h
A f rica is finally rebuilding its educat i o-
nal system.“The basic idea is to fa c i l i t at e
the democratic transform ation of the nat i o n a l
e d u c ation and training system,”s ays Samuel
I s a a c s ,director of the South A f rican Qualifi-
c ations A g e n cy (SAQA) in charge of setting
up the new education system, which is cal-
led the National Qualific ations Framewo r k .
A committed pastor and citizen, Isaacs was at
the forefront of the anti-apartheid stru g g l e .
E d u c ation and professional training
were at the heart of the political stru g g l e
against the former system, and “ e d u c at i o n
for all” was a key theme of Nelson
M a n d e l a ’s speeches as soon as he became
p r e s i d e n t . Youth demonstrations against
s e gr e g ation in education and the attempt to
impose the teaching of A f ri k a a n s , one of
the white minori t y ’s two official languages,
touched off the Soweto ri o t s , c rushed by a
bloody crackdown in 1976.
M a ny grassroots organizat i o n s , l o c a l
church and religious groups and wo m e n ’s
m ove m e n t s , which were ve ry active in the
1 9 8 0 s , set up evening and technical trai-
ning courses for non-white adults to offset
the public education system’s short c o-
m i n g s. To d ay these courses are officially
r e c o g n i z e d .
The new system includes proposals for
lifelong education made in the early 1990s
by the powerful 1.8-million-strong
C o n gress of South A f rican Trade Unions
( C O S AT U ) , which had, alongside the
A f rican National Congress (ANC), p l aye d
a key role in the mobilization against apar-
t h e i d . C O S AT U ’s demands focused on
better training for black wo r k e rs.
To d ay the education of non-white
adults is a pri o ri t y. “ B l a c k s , Coloureds and
A s i a n s ,” according to the official classific a-
t i o n , account for 87 per cent of the popula-
South Africa is responding to one of the people’s main
demands by opening up the education and training system
to all citizens.

tion but hold most of the unskilled, l ow -
paid jobs and have few opportunities to
u p grade their qualific at i o n s. The Jo b
R e s e rvation Act had excluded them from
m a ny jobs and training progr a m m e s. In the
l ate 1980s, only 17 per cent of technicians,
3 per cent of architects and 0.1 per cent of
e n gi n e e rs were black. In public administra-
t i o n ,Whites held 96 per cent of manageri a l
p o s i t i o n s , and while the country ’s economy
is based on mining, there has only eve r
been one black mine manager.The result of
these discri m i n at o ry policies is 38 per cent
u n e m p l oyment among Blacks, c o m p a r e d
to 6 per cent for W h i t e s.
Qualification certificates
Under the new system currently being
d e ve l o p e d , students with “ n o n - f o rm a l ”
training may enter the “ f o rm a l ” e d u c at i o-
nal system at any age. Students leav i n g
school at any level must have access to pro-
fessional training.
“In concrete term s ,” s ays Isaacs, “a per-
son with ten ye a rs ’ on-the-job experience in
a c c o u n t a n cy will be able to obtain a cert i fi-
c ate that will allow him or her to get a pay
r a i s e , apply for a job as an accountant
somewhere else or continue training—to
become a chartered accountant, f o r
e x a m p l e . A highly qualified nurse who
wants to study medicine will enter medical
studies at the interm e d i ate leve l .”
Around forty Education and Tr a i n i n g
Q u a l i fic ation Assurance Bodies (ETQA)
will be authorized to issue “ q u a l i fic at i o n
c e rt i fic at e s ” in eve ry industry, from chemi-
cals to transport at i o n , retail and env i r o n-
mental protection. An inve n t o ry of all the
available training opportunities in the
c o u n t ry is being drawn up. At the same
t i m e , schools and unive rsities will have to
change their programmes to make more
room for science and technology and
encourage gr e ater self-sufficiency on the
p a rt of the learn e r. The reform , which is
called Curriculum 2005, should be com-
pleted by that ye a r.
To fund the progr a m m e , e m p l oye rs ,
including the stat e , must pay a training tax
amounting to between one and 1.5 per cent
of their wage bill. Some companies already
offered training progr a m m e s , mostly to
m a n a g e rial staff. But in 1996, 42 per cent
of companies spent less than one per cent
of their wage bill on training, and 56 per
cent of small firms offered no training at all.
Each year the gove rnment increases the
p r o p o rtion of the education budget alloca-
ted to adult education and training.
Although the amount seems minimal—one
per cent of the total education bu d g e t — i t
has doubled since 1994. In 1997, 450 mil-
lion rands, or $83 million, were spent on
adult education and training.
To d ay, 10 to 15 million adults in South
A f rica lack basic education or skills.An ave-
rage 350,000 adults take training cours e s
each ye a r , but the SAQA expects that the
figure will rise to 700,000 in 1998 and 2.5
million by 2001.
It remains to be seen whether these tar-
gets will be met. Some specialists wonder if
the reform is not too complex for a still-
d e veloping country and fear that the system
favo u rs the best qualified wo r k e rs. A b ove
a l l , c ritics point to a contradiction betwe e n
the gove rn m e n t ’s education plan and its
free-market economic policies, with bu d g e t
c u t b a c k s , especially in educat i o n . S t i l l ,
South A f ri c a ’s far-reaching educat i o n
r e f o rm is a first step towards achieving the
goals of millions of people who were invo l-
ved in the long struggle for democracy and
e q u a l i t y. ■
