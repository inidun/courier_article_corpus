RIGHTS ARE NOT
'FOR MEN ONLY'
Women began actively to organized
the fight for their rights at the start of
the 19th century. They progressively
demanded the right to earn their own
living outside the home and of compet-
ing in factories, business, or the
professions on an equal basis with
men. Here is a woman's trade union
member card issued in Scotland in 1833.
THE story of women's rights
is a fascinating one. They
have been subject, through-
out history, to extraordinary
changes of fortune. In some
instances women have been re-
garded as chattels ; in others, they
have been honoured like sove-
reigns, from the mere fact that
they were women. Civil law has
frequently regarded women as
irresponsible ; but there have also
been matriarchies, in which home
and society alike were founded
upon maternal authority.
There have been periods of total
emancipation, and periods of en-
slavement beyond all hope of deli-
verance. Sometimes men have
placed \vomen in a position of
eminence ; at other times, women
have had to win their own rights
at the cost of a long struggle
against the distrust, fear and deri-
sian of their contemporaries.
In Ancient Egypt, woman,
though for a time enslaved to man,
very soon attained complete equa-
lity with him. Girls, when they
came of age, were given the same
rights as men.
A marriage involved a double
contract, in which the rights and
duties of each spouse were clearly
stated ; these were to all intents and
purposes the same for each party.
These contracts show that the right
to personal property existed for
both sexes, and that either spouse
could divorce at will, subject to
payment of fair compensation.
In the working classes, women
seem to have been given the lighter
tasks, such as weaving or the busi-
ness of buying and selling. Men
were responsible for the hard
work. In the country, women and
children shared labour in the fields
with men, on an equal footing.
Although Egyptian civilization
readily recognized the rights of
women, this was not the case with
most of the peoples of antiquity.
In Ancient Greece, especially
with the Boeotians and the Spar-
tans, society long adhered to the
primitive law that regarded women
as veritable beasts of burden. Wo-
men were bought and sold like
cattle, or captured by force. Even
at a later stage, a father long pre-
served the right of marrying his
daughter on'as he chose, without
consulting her wishes ; and he had
the right of life and death over her.
Philosophers disagree
ATHENIAN civilization grew lessharsh, under the influence
of certain philosophers. But
though Xenophon took up the
defence of women, Plato was
shocked to see them become the
equals of their husbands. Aristotle
declared that women were very
inferior, particularly as regards
their reasoning powers."Virtue is
conceded to them ; but it is a virtue
proportioned to their capacities, and
so a lesser virtue than that of men."
We know, from the comedies of
Aristophanes, to what freedom and
self-reliance women had attained
in his century. But it was custom
rather than law that gave them
this freedom.
In Rome, the legal status of wo-
men varied with the times. At an
early period, they lived in a state
of utter subjection to father or
husband. Except for the priest-
esses, who were granted certain
privileges, women were excluded
from any intellectual life. Cicero,
Tacitus and Cato denied that they
had any capacity for judgment.
At the most, they were consulted
about the choice of a husband ; but
divorce, by mutual consent, was
permitted.
Finally, Seneca and the Stoics in
the first century of the Christian
era, affirmed the equality of the
sexes, though stating that women
were less fitted than men for the
study of philosophy. A system of
co-education was adopted, in the
upper classes, so that a master
could teach a brother and a sister
at the same time.
This accession to intellectual life
enabled women to take a greater
part in the propagation of
Christianity. But women were
not emancipated either in private
or in public law.
The great Renaissance, which
began as early as the twelfth cen-
tury in Mediterranean countries,
was accompanied by a great ad-
vance in women's emancipation.
Chivalry honoured women as a
source of fine feeling. Thus la-
dies, princesses and middle-class
women took a distinguished part
in the social and cultural life of
this period. In Italy more partic-
ularly, in Provence and in Lan-
guedoc, women spoke Latin, wrote
verse, and encourage arts and let-
terms. Certain women even taught
in universities.
The fourteenth century provides
many examples of women of dis-
tinguished mind ; the court of
Queen Joan of Naples was one of
the most brilliant of the period, and
Christine de Pisan, daughter to
Charles V of France's physician-
astrologer, must have been stirred
by the condition of women in her
time, for apart from poems and
tales she wrote The City of Ladies,
a discourse on women's education.
She maintained that the social in-
equality of the sexes was not dictat-
ed by nature :"If it were the
custom to put girls to school and
teach them as boys are taught,
women would understand the sub-
tleties of art and science as well
as men do."It took a few cent-
uries to fulfil this prophecy.
Famous women in the sixteenth
century included Margaret de Na-
The active campaigns for universal suffrage in the 19th century have led to many victories in the 20th. The winning of
suffrage has given women a voice in making the laws which control their own well-being and that of their homes and chil-
dren. ! n 1911 when Danish women gained the right to vote, they acknowledged it in a warm isplay of loyalty to the King.
varre, sister of Francis I : margaret
de Valois, the wife of Henry IV ;
and Miss de Gournay, who was
Montaigne's adopted daughter and
wrote a treatise on the equality of
men and women. So much for
France. In Italy, Angela di Bres-
cia founded the Ursuline order
(1337). In Great Britain, we have
Queen Elizabeth of England and
Mary, Queen of Scots.
Two independent and unpreju-
diced minds of the sixteenth cen-
tury, the great Erasmus and Cor-
nelius Agrippa, championed the
education of women and their
access to professions then closed
to them.
No legal status
IN the following century, inFrance at the time of the
Fronde, some great ladies
played an active part in politics,
while others greatly influenced lite-
rature. It was not long before
the question of women's right to
education, and of their civil rights,
which had been left to custom and
the good pleasure of parents, arose
in a compelling form.
In ancient French and English
law, an unmarried woman or a
widow could go to law, enter into
a contract, or make a will in the
same way as a man. But with
marriage a woman lost all legal
status from this point of view.
In England, Mary Astell (1668-
1731) was the author of two works
demanding the equality of the
sexes in family and social life.
Later, Elizabeth Montagu and
Hannah More, through their
writings and their influence,
continued the struggle for women's
rights. Mary Wollstonecraft was
also devoted to the same cause ;
her Vindication of the Rights of
"IV omen (17 ! J2) claimed economic
rights for women-a prerequisite
of social and political equality-
particularly as regards the labour-
ing classes. This work was de-
dicated to Talleyrand, who had
recommended equal education for
both sexes.
France of the eighteenth century
had made little progress in these
matters from the legal point of
view, but shortly before the Revo-
lution there was a great advance
in outlook particularly among the
bourgeoisie
Sadly prophetic
WHEN the States General wereconvoked in France in 1789,
women presented petitions
for their cause. A pamphlet
demanded that they become eligible
for membership of the Assembly.
Dressmakers, embroideresses and
modistes called for the protection
of their professions,"not to usurp
men's authority, but to be more
highly considered, and to be shel-
tered from adversity".
The women's movement was led
by Olympe de Gouges, who pub-
lished an eloquent Declaration of
the Rights of Woman :
"Woman is born free and equal
to man in rights. The principle of
all sovereignty resides entirely in
the nation, which is'but the asso-
ciation of men and women... The
law must be the same for all... A
woman has the right to mount the
scaffold ; she should also have the
riglit to mount the tribune."This last sentence proved sadly
prophetic, for Olympe de Gouges
was guillotined in 1793, for having
opposed the principles of the
Terror.
After lively controversies during
the nineteenth century the women's

IN EVERY FIELD OF
HUMAN ACTIVITIES
Though most countries have recognized the principle of equal rights for both sexes, women are still
subject to some inequalities and anomalies in their work and everyday lives. But wherever the oppor-
tunity has been given to them, they have more than proved their capacity to meet responsibilities of
citizenship and of professional and vocational life, whether as nurses, teachers, telephonists or artists.
movement continued to expand
under the Third Republic. In 1880,
a few militants demanded the
registration of women as voters.
No positive results were secured
by the end of the century, but
women had succeeded in entering
various liberal professions (the bar,
medicine, etc.).
In England, however, the wo-
men's movement developed on a
large scale, with John Stuart Mill
as its most distinguished cham-
pion. He wrote :"The subordina-
tion of women stands out as an
isolated fact in the midst of
modern institutions... It is a relic
of an ancient intellectual and
moral world, destroyed everywhere,
yet preserved in a single aspect."
In the House of Commons, when
the electoral (reform) bill of 18t
was discussed, he proposed the
substitution of the word"person"
for"man" (as has been done, by
the way, in the Universal Declara-
tion of i !) 48). His motion was
defeated by 106 votes to 86. The
women's movement pointed out
that, several centuries before,
women had had the right of
suffrage, and that no legal act
had been passed to deprive them
of it. Many women thereupon
. entered themselves on the electoral
lists, but the authorities struck
their names off. However, the
movement grew and enfranchise-
inent 1'0)'locul cledions was finally
obtained.,
In most countries political rights
were finally conceded to women
in the twentieth century.
In England, the"suffragette"
movement was vigorously con-
ducted by ChristabeJ Pankhurst
and Annie Kenney. These two
women unflinchingly used the
most riotous forms of publicity-
public demonstrations, tumultuous
meetings, etc.
Hunger-strikers
WOlIIEN'S eligibility for muni-cipal office was sec red
in 1907, but this merely
stimulated the emancipationists to
further efforts. Windows were
broken, letter-boxes were des-
troyed, and the Prime Minister
was insulted in the House of
Commons by suffragettes who had
managed to enter in disguise.
When the militants were put in
prison, they promptly went on
hunger-strike.
'When the first World War broke
out in lûi4 they declared a truce
and went into war service. The
partisans of, women's suffrage
continued to increase ; shortly be-
fore the end of the war, in 1918,
the Representation of the People
Act was carried, giving voting
rights to women over thirty years
of age. This Act was completed,
ml". 28, by it measures that. culiflpd
women to vote at the same age as
men.
In France, between 1897 and
1927, married women obtained the
right to retain their nationality,
to dispose of their salaries, to go to
law, and to be guardians. They
also secured the right to higher
education.
The Constitution of the Fourth
Republic gave women the same
political and civil rights as men, as
is now the case in most countries.
In the United States, women had,
shortly before the end of the 1914-
1918 war, secured the right to vote,
by virtue of an amendment to the
Constitution.
In the political field, the greatest
progress in the fight for women's
rights has been made since the end
of Worid War I. Before 1914 only
four countries-Australia, Fin-
land, New Zealand and Norway--
accorded voting rights to women.
By 1918, the number had increased
to 13, though in some cases rights
were restricted. Between 1917 and
1ü45, however, a further 34 States
gave women the right to vote, and
in the first four years after World
War II, women in 12 other coun-
tries finally enjoyed this right.
Yet by 1949, in only 52 of these
59 States did women have full
voting rights with men and in a
number of other countries the right
is still withheld. Since 104C the
United Nations has been working
to end such discrimination. One
country which recently (November
6, 1952) accorded voting rights to
women is the Lebanon. Here,
women form the majority of the
voting population-395, 000 com-
paned with 38 ;), 000 men of voting
age.
During the past fifty years
women have played an increasing
part in the professions, in industry
and in public affairs. In many
countries they hold public office as
cabinet ministers and some arc
serving their countries as ambassa-
dors. Recently an Indian woman
diplomat, Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi
Pandit, sister of Prime Minister
Nehru of India, was elected Pre-
sident of the United Nations Ge-
neral Assembly.
Though women have proved
their capacity to meet all the res-
ponsibilities of citizenship and of
professional and vocational life
they are still subject to many in-
equalities and anomalies. Discrimi-
nation regarding employment and
education are two examples. The
United Nations is working to bring
about a wider application of the
principle of"equal pay for equal
work"and, in co-operation with
Unesco, to ensure that women are
accorded equal educational oppor-
tunities with men.
