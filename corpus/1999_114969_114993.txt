You once said that the study of economics
offers hope, and that improved
understanding of our economies can better
the lot of humanity. Do you feel economists
have been able to improve the situation of
all humanity, or have they helped some
people more than others?
I think some economists have helped some
p e rsons more than others. T h at ’s quite
l i k e l y. But ye s , I think on the whole
economists have improved the lot of
h u m a n i t y, though we have n ’t done it as
well as I might have hoped.
I began studying economics during the
Great Depression.There was 25 per cent
u n e m p l oyment in the United Stat e s , i n
France probably 15 to 20 per cent, a n d
complete disorder. The intern at i o n a l
political scene was certainly affected by the
failure of the world economy. The rise of
Hitler was directly related to the Great
Depression in Germany.
Anybody who went to college who had
his eyes open and read the newspapers in
the 1930s had the right to be concerned
about the economic situat i o n , and the ri g h t
to believe that failure of the world economy
had a lot to do with the many threats to the
peace of the world, to fascism, nazism and
c o m m u n i s m .To the extent that we learn e d
in the Great Depression  how to keep from
having great depressions anymore we have
reduced the likelihood that things like that
would happen again. We figured out why
there was a depression,and we figured out
w h at kind of monetary and fiscal policies we
could use as a remedy.
It seems that economists have genera l l y
c o n c e n t rated on the production of wealth,
and less on its distribution.
A c c o rding to international org a n i z a t i o n s
l i ke the United Nations Development
P ro g ramme (UNDP), inequality is incre a s i n g
within countries and between countries.
T h a t ’s why one might argue that
economists have concentrated on the
p roduction of wealth, and less on
d i s t r i b u t i o n .
I don’t think that ’s a fair charge against my
p r o f e s s i o n . A c t u a l l y, consider the whole
welfare state that you have in France and
throughout Europe—economists have had
a lot to do with bri n ging it about and
organizing it. We didn’t have those things
when I was younger. Social security didn’t
b e gin in the United States until 1936 duri n g
the depression. We didn’t have publicly
s u p p o rted health care until after the wa r.A
lot of those things have come with the help
and the advocacy of economists.
Why does inequality keep increasing at the
national and international levels?
T h at ’s a really complicated question. I don’t
h ave any single answe r. We ought to be
spending a lot of our energy, our emotion,
and our intelligence to find ways of reducing
inequality both within countries and
between countries.
It hasn’t been ignored by economists.
The World Bank, for example, was founded
in 1945 for that purpose.The reduction of
inequality requires that people who have
e a rned higher incomes in markets be taxe d
in order to improve the standards of living
of the people who have been less fort u n at e ,
who earned less in markets. Among the
major preoccupations of economic policy,
social policy and politics is the level of
t a x ation and the degree to which
g ove rnments transfer your earnings into
the hands of people who are less fort u n at e .
Ta x ation and transfer programmes are a
big political issue.
You ask: w hy don’t democracies succeed
in making more transfers of income and
wealth from the fort u n ate people who earn
a lot to the less fortunate people who earn
much less? And then the same thing is tru e
on a bigger scale between nat i o n s ,b e t we e n
people in one part of the world and people
in another. I suppose if  you really wanted
to reduce inequality across the whole wo r l d
you would try to get rid of all immigration
b a rri e rs , so that people could move
w h e r e ver they want to, to get jobs and higher
wa g e s.T h at would certainly be an immense
political problem.

P
Since 1971 you have been saying that
states need to have at least a minimum
amount of control over their national
monetary policy. With globalization, have
states lost control over monetary policy?
It is true that the globalization of financial
markets has diminished the control that
s t ates have over their own monetary policies.
There always has been a constraint on
m o n e t a ry policy ever since we started hav i n g
some liberalization of monetary regulat i o n s
back in the Bretton Woods system begi n n i n g
in 1945. But that has gone on much more
rapidly in the last few ye a rs , and it does
limit particularly the power of small
c o u n t ries like those in East Asia to run their
own monetary policies.
Given financial globalization, how can
states preserve their monetary autonomy?
Well, they have to have some ways to slow
d own the inflow and outflow of foreign
currency and to make the convertibility of
their own currencies into foreign currency
less damaging to the country as a whole.
Consider for example what happened in
East Asian countri e s , where some of the
banks—the banks in Korea for example—
b o rr owed from New Yo r k , To k yo and
London banks.They borr owed ve ry short -
term, one week or two weeks, so that the
l e n d e rs , the big banks in New York or To k yo
or London could decide eve ry week or two
whether to renew the loan.The commercial
bank in Korea, for example, has to pay back
the New York bank in dollars. H ow is it
going to get the dollars? It is going to take
some Korean wo n , the local curr e n cy, to the
Korean central bank and say “ you promised
to gi ve us so many dollars per wo n . Here is
my won and I want what e ver you have
promised to gi ve for wo n .” So the hard
c u rr e n cy reserves of the country in the
hands of the central bank then eva p o r ate as
the banks pay back their loans.T h at ’s where
the reserves go, and if reserves vanish like
t h at then the curr e n cy will have to be
devalued.That’s what happened in 1998.
If, for example, Korea had had a law
which said banks are not allowed to have
s h o rt - t e rm hard curr e n cy debts that are
u n c overed by corresponding short - t e rm
a s s e t s , then the central bank would be
protecting itself. If they were to have
i n t e r f e r e d , to that degr e e , with complete
g l o b a l i z ation of the Korean banking system
and the Korean money market, it wo u l d
have been a very good thing.
There are a number of ways in which
those countries can protect themselves. A
transaction tax is one method.
That brings us to the so-called Tobin tax.
Could you briefly explain to us what it is
and how it would work?
There are 1.3 trillion dollars a day in foreign
exchange transactions.Those transactions
would be taxe d , at a ve ry low rat e ,
something like one tenth of one per cent per
dollar per transaction.The taxes would be
levied by each country on transactions that
o ri gi n ate in the country, and collected by the
usual tax authority of that country.
If people are invo l ved in making a lot of
transactions eve ry day, e ve ry we e k , t h e y
would have to pay the tax a lot of times.S o
they are discouraged from doing that just by
the existence of the tax.
Would the world look different today if
your tax had been in place since the 1970s?
Would Asia have had the tremendous
growth that we saw, which was partly
fuelled by investments and capital flows?
Would we also have had 
an Asian financial crisis, if the tax had been
in place earlier?
Of the 1.3 trillion dollars in transactions per
d ay, ve ry few have to deal with the move m e n t
of productive capital from the savings of one
c o u n t ry into the investment of another
c o u n t ry. D e veloped countries nowa d ay s
m ove about 200 billion dollars a year into
i nvestment in developing countri e s. So mos t
of the transactions that occur are not relat e d
directly to desirable movements of
p r o d u c t i ve capital from developed to
underdeveloped countries.
China doesn’t have full convertibility,
except of Chinese curr e n cy earned by
f o r e i g n e rs in trade. You cannot conve rt
Chinese currency into dollars or francs or
yen just to move funds around.They have
strict financial control very much like the
controls that France had in 1945-46 right
after the wa r. In fa c t , France had exchange
controls of some kind until the middle of the
1 9 8 0 s. China receives a lot of direct
investments from overseas without having
c o nve rtibility of capital funds from one
c u rr e n cy to another. I t ’s not essential to
have that.
Most of the investment from deve l o p e d
into underdeveloped countries wo u l d n ’t
have been influenced significantly by the
Tobin tax, by the exchange transaction tax.
In fa c t , the advantage of that device is  that
it doesn’t tax long-range inve s t m e n t s
appreciably at all. If you take a 20-ye a r
round trip by putting equity capital into
an underdeveloped country, s ay from
France into Viet Nam, and you don’t take
the money out for 20 ye a rs , you pay a tenth
of a percent the first time and a tenth of a
per cent coming back. T h at wo u l d n ’t
influence your calculation about whether
you want to make the investment.It’s only
the ve ry short - t e rm movements of
c u rrencies that would have been
discouraged.
So would the so-called Tobin tax  have
actually prevented an Asian crisis?
C e rtainly you need other things as we l l .
You need reforms in your own banking
system and stock markets. The other big
m i s t a k e , perhaps a bigger mistake than
some of the things we have been discussing,
is the practice of having a fixed exchange
rate.You wouldn’t have the currency crisis
if you didn’t have a fixed exchange rate. A
f i xed exchange rate is a promise by the
central bank of the country to pay a fixed
amount of dollars , ye n , euros or a basket of
s e veral curr e n c i e s. If the central bank
doesn’t have a reserve of hard currency, it
has to default on this promise. It’s like the
failure of an ordinary bank. If depositors
come and ask for cash for their deposits
and the bank doesn’t have them, then the

bank has to close and there is a crisis.
In the light of the Asian crisis,
many of the countries in Asia feel that 
they have lost their power, that there has
been a shift in the balance 
of power between the state and the free
market. Do you think that view has any
substance?
I think that they are right about that to a
considerable degr e e .The financial markets
being completely liberalized and in my view
p r e m aturely liberalized, l e aves gove rn m e n t s
without the control or restrictions which
they need to limit the speed and volume of
m ovements of funds in and out of their
currencies.
Do you think we will continue to have big
financial crises. Are we learning from our
mistakes?
Financial crises are not inevitable. I think we
will probably learn from  mistakes and we
wo n ’t go back—at least in the case of these
countries—to trying to defend a fixed rate
of exchange, against dollars or ye n , a n d
t h at will certainly make crises less frequent.
The whole of history is peppered with
i n t e rn ational financial cri s e s. I am not sure
it’s right that they are more frequent now.
There are more people in adva n c e d
c o u n t ries who have put money into
c o u n t ries where crises occurr e d . I n
p a rt i c u l a r ,c o u n t ries in Asia had gr own ve ry
r a p i d l y, almost miraculously, for two or
three decades and had promoted themselve s
to higher echelons and higher places in the
pecking order of countries and economies.
They have a lot of the trappings of the
m o d e rn European or A m e rican economy —
stock markets, bond markets, m o n e y
m a r k e t s , all these things—and gr ow i n g
l e vels of wealth and income. They have
much closer ties to financial enterp ri s e s
ove rseas in major countri e s. So there was a
bigger shock when they couldn’t maintain
their promises to pay dollars to banks in
America and Japan.
Do you think is there any chance of the
Tobin tax being implemented one day. In
France there is a movement to promote it.
Political fig u res agree with this tax when
they are in opposition. But when they are in
power they don’t talk about the Tobin tax.
I am not optimistic about that . I don’t think
the financial community, i n c l u d i n g
m i n i s t e rs of finance in major countries and
the central banks of those countries, have
a ny use for those taxe s.They don’t want it.
Even if somebody else in the government
may say good things about it as François

attempt to regulate capital flows so as to
help prevent the kind of crisis we have
seen in A s i a ?
I don’t think there is going to be any
i n t e rn ationally co-ordinated policy. I do think
t h at there is going to be more tolerance by the
IMF and by the gove rnments in Nort h
A m e rica and Europe of developing countri e s.
In some of those cases I think there’s probably
not a big disagr e e m e n t . For example, t h e
banking systems of those countries were not
ready to be part of intern ational fin a n c i a l
m a r k e t s. They we r e n ’t ready because they
d i d n ’t have the institutional and legal
f r a m e works that we take for granted in our
s y s t e m s. A l s o, consider securities markets.
In the United States we have had a federal
a g e n cy, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) since the 1930s. Yo u
c a n ’t sell stocks and bonds on the open
market without regi s t e ring complete
i n f o rm ation about it with the SEC.Yet many
of our pri vate financial firms helped set up
exchanges in underdeveloped countries which

finance ministry.They are not going to go
for it, the Intern ational Monetary Fund
(IMF) is not going to go for it.
People do not like to be taxe d .They think
it is an interference with the free market.
Hasn’t there been a little bit of a shift in
the way people think?
A little bit of a shift, r e a l i z at i o n , s o m e
recognition at the last big meetings of the
IMF and the World Bank. Some recognition
t h at maybe globalizat i o n , l i b e r a l i z at i o n
i n t e rn ationally has gone too fa s t , too fa r. B u t
there’s been no actual proposal as to how
that would be remedied.At least they did
express a little more openness to consideri n g
ways in which flows of funds now in
different currencies could be moderated. I
n e ver heard them mention the tax. I did see
only one mention, in which Mr Michel
C a m d e s s u s , head of the IMF, said he saw no
support for international taxation.
Do you see there being some sort of

The financial markets being completely liberalized 
and in my view prematurely liberalized, leaves
governments without the control or restrictions which
they need to limit the speed and volume of movements 
of funds in and out of their currencies

In fact, it was the original idea behind
the IMF. All the countries had in the
b e ginning rather generous drawing rights in
the IMF which they could use  without
question. Now they are certainly not big
enough  because the total size of the quotas
of all the countries together in the IMF is
about 150 billion dollars,which is nothing
for a worldwide institution that ’s supposed
to do what they are supposed to do.
I think the World Bank is different. I
am afraid in the last couple of years, the
IMF has started taking over what was the
World Bank responsibility. The IMF
p r e s c riptions for the countries in East A s i a ,
whom they were presumably helping,
included prescriptions for fundamental
changes in institutions in the interest of
reforming the long-run structure of those
e c o n o m i e s. But that was supposedly the
mission of the World Bank,not of IMF.
Economists have made great strides over
the last decades. But they were unable to
predict something as great as the financial
crisis in Asia. Why is that? Why, despite all
these advances in economics, are
economists unable to foresee or forecast
these kinds of crises?
You can’t predict financial markets. If you
could predict them, then the process of
acting on your prediction to get money, to
get profit s ,r e m oves the possibility of making
money in them. They are mat t e rs of
e x p e c t ations and emotions, and they are
not predictable really.
As for the general question of why can’t
economists predict things: t h at strikes me as
really unfa i r. M e t e o r o l o gists know a lot
about we ather but their predictions are not
always accurate.Doctors know a lot about
human disease but they are often surp ri s e d ,
often incapable of doing anything about it.
So we are not alone in our failures.
Do you think that there has been generally
a shift towards market mechanisms in
education,science and culture. If so, has it
been a good thing or not?
I think it’s hard to make generalizat i o n s
about that. I think it’s true that there has
been a movement against gove rn m e n t
r e g u l ation around the wo r l d . For example,
p ri vat i z ation of gove rn m e n t - ow n e d
e n t e rp ri s e s. In many countri e s , a lot of that
was not necessary, wa s n ’t part i c u l a r l y
desirable.I think we have in this country a
lot of people, including one of our political
p a rt i e s , who are opposed to using
g ove rnment money for culture, who wo u l d
like to transfer gove rnment money from
public education into subsidizing pri vat e
education,private schools.There has been
a trend in that direction.
Do you think it’s a good trend?
I think the spirit of it is not a good trend. I n
general it’s selfish and short-sighted. n
Interview by Sophie Boukhari,
d i d n ’t have these kinds of essential safeguards.
It would be ve ry reasonable for a
country like Thailand or Korea to regulate
the amount of foreign currency debt held
not only by the banks in their countri e s
but also by the corp o r ations in their
countries.What you really want to do is to
encourage your companies to attract equity
investments,because they are not going to
cause you to have a currency crisis.
In the context of financial crises, what is
the role of institutions like the IMF and
World Bank? What is your ideal of how they
should operate? Are they adequate, alone,
to address some of the issues like
development and amelioration of situations
where there is a financial crisis? Do we
need other financial institutions, such as a
World Central Bank?
I think the IMF could move in the direction
of being a world central bank—which is more
like what it was meant to be. T h at means
t h at it would be prepared to prov i d e
i n t e rn ational liquidity to countries getting
into trouble without pretending that they are
guilty of crimes and have to be punished as a
p rice of the assistance. A central bank in a
c o u n t ry which serves as a lender of last resort
for banks in that country lends to them when
they have liquidity problems without acting as
though they committed a cri m e .They expect
to be paid back short l y.We should see more
of that spirit on the part of the IMF.
