Young Peruvians set up a
pioneering movement for
working children and
t e e n a g e rs
nThey’re called “Nats”, the acronym of
Niños y Adolescentes Trabajadores—Child
and Teenage Wo r k e rs. The term mainly
r e f e rs to needy children in towns and cities,
although there are more child wo r k e rs in the
countryside. Poverty, unemployment and
family problems, including violence, have
pushed them onto the streets. Often it isn’t
possible—or even desirable—for them to
r e t u rn home to their parents. They fre-
quently work in very harsh conditions and
are exploited and mistreated.
The Intern ational Labour Organisat i o n
reckons there are 17.5 million child wo r k e rs
in Latin A m e ri c a , but some NGOs say there
are between 25 and 30 million, including
1.5 to 2 million in Pe ru .The United Nat i o n s
has criticized Pe ru for being the only
country in Latin America to legally allow
children to work from the age of 12, i n s t e a d
of 14 as elsewhere.
The Nats in Lima, Peru’s capital, were
the first children in the world to organize
t h e m s e l ves in a social move m e n t . In the
early 1970s, m e m b e rs of the Christian Wo r-
kers Youth Movement opened centres for
street children in the city’s poorest neigh-
b o u r h o o d s. Most of the centres looked after
children who earned a living doing odd
jobs in open-air markets.
A national charter
But when Lima city council threat e n e d
in 1976 to sell the land on which the street
c h i l d r e n ’s centres stood, there was an outcry.
In the southern part of the city, the children,
their parents, grandparents and others got
together to defend the centres. They also
demanded that the centres be connected to
water,electricity and sewage services.The
children and teenagers called for access to
school places and health care.
The protests brought the children’s
centres together into a loose netwo r k , a n d
gradually the movement took shape. Its sup-
p o rt e rs developed the idea of “ p r o t a g o-
n i s m ” ,i .e.considering children as respon-
sible people, defending their right to wo r k ,
and believing in their ability to act for them-
s e l ve s , organize and generally improve their
own situation.
The Movement of Working Children of
Christian Workers (MANTHOC) was set
up in Lima in 1978.“Our aim was to streng-
then a movement established by and for
children and geared to their specific needs,”
s ays Nelly To rr e s , the founder of MAN-
THOC. “We wanted them to share their
e x p e riences with the majority of street chil-
dren, who weren’t organized.”The move-
ment slowly spread to other tow n s , e ve n
though it still only invo l ved a ve ry small
number of Nats.
TodayTorres runs the National Move-
ment of Peruvian Young Workers’ Organi-
z ations (MNNAT S O P ) , a federation set
up in 1996 representing nearly 10,000 chil-
dren between 7 and 14 living in 18 towns all
over the country. It has drawn up a nat i o n a l
charter for the rights of Nats. Its members
point out that because the school dropout
r ate is ve ry high, children are better off
working rather than hanging about the
streets all day long. A job can even help
keep their families together by providing
extra income.
M N N ATSOP believes that the essential
thing is for the Nats to earn respect, and
encourages them to associate in produc-
tion workshops to demand better working
c o n d i t i o n s. A credit system has been set
up to enable the most vulnerable Nats to
reduce their working hours so they can
study or enjoy themselves.
MNNATSOP considers it very impor-
tant to develop good relations with the
a u t h o ri t i e s. Last ye a r , it scored a success by
signing an agreement with the Lima city
g ove rn m e n t , which promised to create 600
jobs for Nats over the next two ye a rs. N e g o-
t i ations to win social security rights are also
going on, though so far without success.
However,a number of ad hoc agreements
h ave been signed with hospitals and clinics
which have agreed to provide child wo r-
kers with free medical care.
More progress seems to have been made
on the educational front, thanks to efforts by
NGOs and by the gove rn m e n t . M A N-
THOC opened the first school for Nats in
1986 in a south Lima neighbourhood. It wa s
geared to child wo r k e rs ’h o u rs and interests.
In 1996,the ministry of education started
special programmes for Nats in 9 of the
capital’s primary schools.
M N N ATSOP also has a scheme to pro-
tect young wo r k e rs called Colibri , which is
run by the national police force. “ We try to
protect street children from delinquents,
but also from abuse by city officials who
m i g h t , for example, seize the wares of unau-
t h o rized child ve n d o rs ,” s ays Col. Luis Her-
mosa Ortega.
“I ran away from home because my
dad’s new wife beat me,” says Pablo Ortiz
V i c u ñ a , a 12-year-old being looked after
by Colibri offic i a l s.“ N ow I live at the house
of a friend who washes cars like me. S o m e-
times I go begging but only when I don’t
have anything to eat.” n
