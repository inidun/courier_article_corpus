remembers “Left- 
handed Lenny.*’Lenny was the hurricane that 
came from the wrong side. Most hurricanes in the 
Caribbean start in the Atlantic Ocean and move 
through the islands from east to west. “Hurricane 
Lenny was different,” remembers Gillian Cambers, 
a beach erosion specialist who lives in Puerto 
Rico. “It started off the coast of Colombia in 
the western Caribbean, and instead of moving 
north or west, as the forecasters predicted, began 
moving east. It got stronger as it went, building 
up bigger and bigger waves.” In a couple of days 
in mid-November 1999 it had caused physical 
damage to the islands estimated at around US$269 
million, without counting loss of revenue. For 
Grenada alone, one of the worst hit, the damage 
was over US$94 million, or 27 percent of its GDP?. 
“No warnings had been given, no boats had 
been pulled up,” recalls Cambers. “And, strangest

of all for many islanders, there was no wind. It 
was the waves that wreaked havoc. Most of the 
tourism infrastructure is concentrated on the west 
coasts of the Caribbean islands, because they are 
sheltered from the prevailing easterly winds. But 
they were not sheltered from Hurricane Lenny. 
Houses disappeared, hotels and roads were 
damaged and flooded, fishing boats were lost, 
and the west coast beaches in every island in 
the chain from Tobago in the south to the Virgin 
Islands in the north were eroded, just one month 
before the start of the tourism high season. The 
economic impact was huge. Hotels had to close 
for months, in some cases more than a year, to try 
to repair the damage and put back their beaches.” 
Lenny caught the islanders out, but they are 
used to hurricanes. In the Caribbean, there is a 
hurricane ‘season’ that runs roughly from June 
to November. And, before tourism became a 
significant money-earner, experience led islanders

to build either inland, or a reasonable distance 
from the coast. “Lenny didn’t do much to the 
inland infrastructure,” says Arlington James, of 
Dominica’s Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division, 
“but the waves from Lenny did affect the coast. 
Some beaches were only just recovering from 
tropical storm Iris, Hurricane Marilyn and then 
Hurricane Luis that hit us in the space of two 
weeks in 1995. And before that, we’d been hit by 
Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Belle Hall, a very wide 
and popular beach up north is now just a strip of 
boulders.” 
PREVENTION IS CHEAPER 
THAN REPAIR 
| 1 | But Dominica has little tourism, unlike most other 
Caribbean islands. And tourism often means 
beachside hotels and refreshment stalls. When 
8 a beach disappears after a hurricane, not only 
is the main tourist attraction lost, but ill-placed 
hotels, roads, water supplies and shops often go 
with it. And, increasingly, some islands depend 
on tourism. In 2000, for example, visitors spent 
some $277 million in Saint Lucia, accounting for 
over 40 percent of its Gross National Product.? Yet 
much of the damage could be avoided. “People 
often feel they must build right on the beach, and 
it is hard for planning authorities to convince 
them otherwise,” explains Gillian Cambers. “But 
beaches are dynamic features, always moving 
and changing shape. We draw a line on a map, 
a solid, permanent line, and this represents the 
coastline. In fact, the coastline, or the area where 
the sea meets the land, is a moving zone, varying 
in position according to the tides, waves and 
storm conditions, the time of year, sediment and 
other factors.” 
“By allowing beaches the space to move, there 
is a good likelihood that they will be conserved 
in the long term,” she adds. Instead, out of 
ignorance, or an attitude of ‘it won’t happen here’, 
developers still build too close to the water. And 
in often-misguided efforts to protect the beach or 
the infrastructure, they, or local municipalities, 
build protective sea walls or erect groynes into 
the sea to lessen the impact of waves. But both 
measures are often counterproductive. Sea walls 
invariably increase beach erosion, while sand 
tends to build up on one side of a groyne and 
disappear on the other. 
“Beach erosion is very complex,” says Gillian 
Cambers. “And, while every beach is different, 
there is also no single erosion mitigation method

that works everywhere.” A UNESCO project 
monitoring changes in beaches over time® has 
shown that, over a ten-year period, two-thirds 
of the beaches monitored showed erosion, while 
the remaining third were either building up or 
showed no change. This uniqueness of beaches 
and preventive measures is one reason UNESCO 
has been working with ten island authorities in 
the Caribbean to produce a series of tailor-made 
brochures aimed to raise awareness and to give 
very specific guidance on building precautions on 
a beach-by-beach basis. 
“We use the brochures with our students, non 
governmental organizations and environment 
groups,” says Benjie Farrell, of the Environment 
Department, St Kitts. 
“Most of our population are familiar with the 
issues, but we still need to emphasise attitude 
change in the coastal zone.” And, to prove his 
point, he says that, in a recent development, 
“twenty acres of harbour were reclaimed from 
the sea, and filled in with boulders. Now it’s a 
shopping mall. It’s affecting the wave patterns 
in the area and these are affecting the adjacent 
beaches.” And the added irony of this is that 
offshore sand is often used to make the concrete 
for the buildings. But, in time, they will probably 
all return to the sea - and end up as beaches 
again.

D About 20 percent of 
world population (some 
1,147 million people) live 
within 30 km of the nearest 
coastline. In small island 
developing states, like 
the Seychelles, and some 
Caribbean islands, this 
figure can be more like 90 
percent. The coastal zone 
has the highest diversity of 
plant and animal species 
and many small islands are 
almost entirely dependent 
on their coastal resources 
(e.g. fishing, tourism, etc). 
But all coasts worldwide are 
under threat from various 
aggressions, such as sea 
level rise as a result of global 
warming, destruction of 
protective coral reefs and 
mangrove forests (which 
act as natural wave-breaks), 
beach erosion, increased 
storms, land-based pollution, 
unsustainable development, 
etc.

dynamic, constantly eroding 
and being replenished. They 
absorb the shock of large 
waves and storms and, 
unimpeded, can ‘retreat’ 
inland, reverting to their 
earlier position months 
or years later. But solid 
structures, like roads, sea 
walls and the foundations 
of buildings, when too 
close to the beach, prevent 
this natural process and 
inevitably lead to erosion. 
In some African states, like 
Nigeria, parts of the coastline 
are disappearing at as much 
as 20-30 metres a year. 
) Dunes also provide a 
protective barrier against 
waves. When dunes are 
removed for development, 
(or destroyed by hurricanes), 
beach erosion accelerates 
dramatically. Techniques 
exist to encourage their 
reformation, like erecting 
picket fences to trap sand. 
But these take time to work.

Top right: building Similarly, eroded beaches 
can be replenished artificially 
by extracting sand offshore 
and dumping it on the 
beach. Wealthier Caribbean 
beachside hotels often do 
this following a hurricane. 
But it is expensive and can 
cause other problems. 
D Beach erosion is not just 
a problem for small islands 
and developing countries. The 
US state of Florida spends 
around $8.6 million every 
year on erosion management. 
This includes regular beach 
monitoring. And thanks to 
such monitoring (often by 
volunteers) in Caribbean 
islands, it has been possible 
to develop individual profiles 
beach-by-beach over several 
years, showing which are 
most vulnerable. This is 
needed to draw up guidelines 
on ‘wise practises’, such 
as the series of booklets
