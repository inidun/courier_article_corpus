The world’s GDP(US$ billions) The world’s GDPper capita (1995 US$)
While the world is growing richer, inequality is increasing and extreme poverty remains deeply
e n t re n c h e d , as critics of globalization’s current style are quick to underline.
Global GDP has grown fivefold in real terms over the
past 25 years (top left), though over the same
period global GDP per capita only increased 3.5 times
( a b o v e, l e f t ) .This growth, h o w e v e r, has not been shared
by all.
The absolute number of people living on less than
a dollar a day in developing countries has remained
practically unchanged (slightly fewer than 1.2 billion)
over the past decade  (below).The income gap between
the richest and poorest 20 per cent of world population
has more than doubled over the past 40 years (oppo-
site page, top left),and nearly tripled if we look at the
w o r l d ’s five richest and five poorest countries (opposite
p a g e, top right).These disparities are even more striking
in specific areas:the poorest 20 per cent,for example,
only account for 0.2 per cent of the world’s Internet
users, while the richest 20 per cent make up 93.3 per
cent of users (opposite page, centre).
Fi n a l l y, a comparison between the sales of top cor-
porations and the GDP of a number of countries offers
a telling illustration of the sheer power of big business
(opposite page, below).
