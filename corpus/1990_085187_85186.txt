A MUSEUM FOR PEACE
BY HOWARD BRABYN
I F you stand in the grassed over
quarry that now forms part of the
gardens of the Memorial Museum for
Peace, on the outskirts of Caen in
Normandy, France, your eye will
perhaps be caught by a seemingly
insignificant, newly-planted sapling.
Under two metres in height, there
is nothing to distinguish it from the
other trees in the garden except the
plaque that informs the curious that it
is a gift from the people of the United
States, a sequoia sempen/irens, a
Redwood, the world's tallest species
of tree, that one day will tower above
its neighbours at its maximum height
of 90 metres or more.
Opened in 1988, the Memorial
Museum for Peace was built to com¬
memorate those who died in the
Battle of Normandy in 1944, the big¬
gest battle in the history of mankind
It also honours the people of Caen,
who saw their city reduced to rubble
around them in the struggle for
liberation.
But the Museum is not just another
memorial, not just another war
museum full of rusty war relics and a
somewhat distasteful hint of glorying
over the vanquished enemy. It is a
monument to the obstinate determi¬
nation of human beings to safeguard
their freedom, and a laboratory in
which to study the causes and
prevention of armed conflict. Today,
it could well claim to be on the way
to becoming the world's first Univer¬
sity of Peace.
In January this year, thirty-four
selected American students are to
come together at the University of
Texas, Austin, to take part in the first
Normandy Scholar Program, spon
sored by the US Normandy Founda¬
tion and devised with the advice of
a board of leading American histori¬
ans. They will spend four weeks at
the University of Texas, eight weeks
at the Memorial Museum for Peace,
and a final two weeks back in Austin.
According to Anthony Stout, Chair¬
man of the US Normandy Founda¬
tion, whose father was closely
involved with General Eisenhower in
the planning and execution of the
Normandy landings, "the idea of this
course is to teach the Second World
War as a 'case study' and to find out
how people who don't want to wind
up in a war wind up in a war".
This "case study" approach will in¬
volve an in-depth examination of con¬
ditions in Europe before, during and
after the two World Wars with the
aim of finding answers to such ques¬
tions as.
How did the Second World War
happen so soon after another, gruell¬
ing war between many of the same
combatants, and could it have been
avoided?
Why were the Allies reluctant to
resist the Nazis until it was almost too
late?
What role did world economic con¬
ditions play as the war approached?
What role was played by the press,
the Churches and other institutions7
Many of these questions and
others raised by the conflict are as
relevant to peace now as they were
in 1939. Many are central to issues
being faced and debated by leaders
today and to issues which will be
faced as society moves into the next
century.
The initial pilot programme will
consist of four major courses covering
the economic background, the cul¬
tural and intellectual history of France
in the European context from the
1880s, communications and an as¬
sessment of the role of all the media,
and leadership and strategy before
and during the Second World War.
The Memorial Museum for Peace
provides the ideal setting for studies
of this kind. Located on the outskirts
of Caen, the pivot around which the
Battle of Normandy revolved, only a
few miles from the beaches at which
the Allied forces landed, it is sited
literally on top of the underground
bunker that served as the command
post of General Wilhelm Richter of
the German 716th Infantry Division
which faced the Anglo-Canadian
forces advancing on Caen. Even
today there are many people still
living in the area who can give first¬
hand accounts of life under the Nazi
occupation and of the battle that
raged throughout Normandy for
seventy-six days.
The Museum is designed as "a
voyage through history", starting
with the signing of the armistice in
1918. Visitors entera huge cylinder,
round which a descending spiral
ramp leads them through an impres¬
sive collection of photographs,
posters, and audio-visual displays
covering the period 1918 to 1938
The scenes depicting "the failure of
peace and the rise of the dictators"
include not only political events such
as the coming to power of Adolf
Hitler or the Anschluss, but also back¬
ground evocations of the Jazz Age,
the world economic depression, the
Wall Street crash of 1 929, and so on.
The ramp leads down to a large
black dome where a huge, out-of-
focus picture of Hitler is projected in
an eerie violet light and the dictator's
voice is heard as a menacing, incom¬
prehensible mumble. The world has
reached the pit of despair.
As visitors move out of the cylinder
they come to the first of a maze of
rooms in which are successively
depicted the French surrender in
1940; France under the Nazi occupa¬
tion and the Vichy Government, with
all the horror of the execution of
hostages and resistance fighters, the
desperate daily search for food; the
entry of the United States into the
fighting and the period of "Total
War"; a restrained treatment of the
deportations, the concentration
camps and the mass murder of the
Jews of Europe, films of the key
points of the war such as the Battle
of Britain, Midway, El-Alamein,
Guadalcanal and Stalingrad.
The next section of the Museum is
perhaps more conventional, with dis¬
plays of weapons and military equip¬
ment that reflect the technological
and industrial progress that the
urgent demands of war provoked.
After climbing up a short stairway
visitors enter an area which sets the
scene for a truly amazing documen¬
tary film, projected on a wide, split
screen and simultaneously showing
the Normandy landings as seen from
both the Allied and German sides.
The grand finale of the visit is
reserved for a film on the defence of
liberty and human rights, an expla¬
nation of the philosophy of the
Museum and a special message of
peace and hope.
Writing about the Museum, its
founding father Jean-Marie Girault,
French senator and mayor of Caen,
declared' "It is our intention to arouse
the consciousness of all men and
women who visit the Museum, from
whatever country, so that they may
realize that the tragedies surrounding
liberty are as much a part of our con¬
temporary world as they are of his¬
tory, and that it is imperative that
each individual person should renew
his efforts on behalf of peace, frater¬
nity and solidarity."
This intention the Memorial
Museum for Peace triumphantly
fulfils Inside its walls there is no
glorification of war but an unforget¬
table lesson in peace.
