talks to



Juan Carlos
Cáceres
Instrumentalist, singer and painter, Juan Carlos
Cáceres is a one-man history of the Argentine tango,
vividly evoking its pathos and sensuality in paintings,
pastels and his latest recording, Sudacas. Here he
describes some unusual and little-known facets of this
enduringly popular musical form, the memorable
characters who have contributed to it, and the many
musical influences that have fashioned it since the
19th century.
Isabelle Leymarie: What is
the tango and where did you get
your passion for it?
Juan Carlos Cáceres: The tango is
one of Latin America's richest
kinds of music. Even the older
pieces are sometimes surpris¬
ingly modern and harmonically
adventurous, not to mention
work by more recent com¬
posers like Astor Piazzolla.
I come from Buenos Aires,
which is the home of the tango
and has an extraordinary jazz
school and excellent musi¬
cians. As a child I spent a lot
of time listening to the radio.
At that time there was a pro¬
gramme on the tango of the
1920s, but they also played
recordings from the last cen¬
tury what they call today
the tango of the Old Guard. I
can still remember the pro¬
gramme's opening announce-

ment, which said: "Tango of
the Old Guard, from the can¬
dombe to the habanera, from
the habanera to the fandango,
from the fandango to the
milonga, from the milonga to
the tango." They also broad¬
cast a famous tango called El
Porteñitol . Old-style tango was
played with anything the
musicians could lay their
hands on. It was a two-speed
tango, often played by neigh¬
bourhood brass bands, or
municipal or military brass
bands performing in band¬
stands in town squares. One of
the first important tango
recordings was made in 1907.
The music was recorded in
Paris by the brass band of the
Republican Guard! I also
liked listening to Aníbal
Troilo, who in the 1940s was a
famous player of the bando-
nion, a kind of portable har¬
monium or accordion that is
popular in Latin America.
The first tango age
stretched from the 1880s to
1920, a time when bandonions
were few and far between. The
bandonion first turned up in
the Rio dc la Plata region
around 1870 during the war
with Paraguay, when a mulatto
named Santa Cruz played
polkas and mazurkas on it.
During this first period all
tango musicians were black or
mulatto, and the tango was
street music, outsiders' music.
The whites listened to classical
music. Later the tango blended
with other types of dance for
couples, and its instrumenta¬
tion developed. Barrel organs,
which could easily he taken
outside, were ideal for produc¬
ing hitter-sweet sounds. Brass
bands, with their big horns and
flutes, played the tango in its
most polished form at that
time. Trios and quartets made
up of such instruments as
flutes, clarinets, violins and
harps and guitars played it in
brothels. Fancy brothels had
pianos, and pianists also played
ragtime.
I. L: It is often forgotten
that the tango resulted from a
meeting between many different
cultures.
J. C. C: That's right. As early as
1880 it is possible to see links
with Brazilian music in the
milonga, which was sung by
the gauchos of the Buenos
Aires suburbs and whose bass
line shows Cuban influences.
Some notes in the tango are
also close to those of jazz.
People always talk about an
input from the United States,
hut I think it's much more
important to emphasize the
close ties between the coun¬
tries of the southern half of
South America and the rest of
Latin America and the
Caribbean. Argentina has never
been the isolated nation it's
sometimes thought to have
been. The long couplets of the
milonga were sung by

payadores, itinerant singers
who accompanied themselves
on the guitar. The milonga
blended with the tango and
became the tango-milonga. In
the 1920s, which are consid¬
ered to be a golden age of the
tango, the violinist Julio De
Caro codified this music and
defined its colour. Sextets then
started to appear, generally
consisting of two bandonions,
two violins, a piano and a bass.
I. L: The important
contribution from the candombe
is also often forgotten when
talking about the roots of the
tango.
J.CC: There are traces of the
candombe in Sudacas, the
record I made recently. You
can still hear the influence of
this old religious music of the
blacks of Rio de la Plata in the
strong beat and syncopation of
the tango and the milonga.
Until the 1950s, the tango was
deeply rooted in popular cul¬
ture, and the bands that
played in the open air played it
with an incredible swing
without amplifiers. The best
musicians have always played
with a swing, but the tradition
of improvization has gone.
There was also a particularly
erotic version of the tango
called the tango con corte,
which came from one of the
figures of the candombe. It
was danced by the ordinary
people, but it was banned. For
a while even lunfardo, Buenos
Aires slang, was forbidden.
Then the Argentine middle
classes introduced the tango to
Europe before the First World
War, and it even became fash
ionable in Russia. The Pope
issued a bull forbidding the
tango for being too sensual, and
Argentine dancers were sent to
the Vatican to dance for him in
an attempt to persuade him to
go back on his decision. In the
1930s the tango lost its bite. A
vogue for sung tango came in,
with Carlos Gardel as its repre¬
sentative figure. Then came a
tango revival in the 1940s.
Influenced by North American
music, it went from a binary
measure to one in four-time.
The old repertoire was played
again, and Aníbal Troilo kept
the phrasing of the milonga.
I. L: How have you managed
to pursue a double career as a
painter and a musician?
J.CC: I started painting very
young (I studied at the
Buenos Aires Art School), also
playing the piano and the
trombone. I was especially
fond of the tango and jazz,
particularly cool jazz; I liked
its romantic side. By the way,
after the Second World War,
several French musicians set¬
tled in Argentina and spread
the influence of Django
Reinhardt. This gave rise to a
unique guitar school in
Argentina. In the 1920s sev¬
eral tango musicians also
spent some time in the United
States. When they returned,
they incorporated new jazz
chords into their works. After
the 1966 coup d'état, I went
to Spain, and then settled in
France where in 1977 I
formed a tango group called
Gotán (the word tango in
reverse). I was the pianist and
arranger. We had an alto vio¬
lin, a viola, a bandonion, a
bass and an electric guitar.
We played a lot of original
pieces. Then I went through a
patch where I couldn't find
any musicians I could get
along with, and so I spent
more time painting. I pro¬
duced a fresco of Latin
America history and I also
took some ideas from the
French Revolution. In 1989 I
went back to music, which
had come to be a kind of
therapy. I formed a new
group called Tangofón with
two saxes, a piano, a bass, a
bandonion and drums, and I
started singing professionally.
I. L: Your painting also
expresses the magic of the world
of the tango.
J.CC: The tango is still my
main source of inspiration.
I've painted Carlos Gardel,
the bandonionist Astor
Piazzolla when he was playing
with Aníbal Troilo, whose
arranger he was, couples
dancing, pimps, dives, broth¬
els and even a canvas showing
the tango dancers who went
to dance for the Pope. In the
