THE CONTINUING BARRIER
TRANSLATION & EAST-WEST COMMUNICATIONS
he regular appearance of the Index Transla¬
tionum and Its constantly increasing size has
been one of the encouraging signs of the growth of
collaboration between nations, and it is with considerable
interest that one looks into its well-printed pages and
studies the evidence of the cumulative dissemination of
ideas by means of the more or less prompt translation of
the world's literature.
The 1962 volumethe thirteenth in the present series-
lists some thirty-two thousand translations published in
fifty-eight countries In 1960, Including a few Issued in
earlier years, and one Is Impressed by the efficiency of the
co-operating national organizations that have contributed
the detailed entries. One is also moved that world-famous
names throughout the whole period from Aeschylus to
Tolstoy and beyond are represented by a score or more of
translations in a single year.
A note of caution, however, begins to sound as one exa¬
mines the pages more closely and, in doing so, I have
myself returned to an article ("Translations as a Factor
of East-West Communications," Unesco Bulletin for Li¬
braries, Vol. XI, 5-6, May-June 1957; The Unesco Courier,
April 1958), which I wrote five years ago, with the idea of
ascertaining what progress, If any, had been made in
this field toward the improvement of East-West communi¬
cations. In that article I gave a statistical analysis
which showed only too clearly that at that time East and
West were for the most part Ignoring the intellectual and
cultural riches of the other.
It is true that the Index Translationum of those days
did not receive the support, it does today and that its
contents were therefore far from comprehensive.
Nevertheless, it was manifest that a more complete record
would hardly have revealed a more encouraging picture.
Today the Index Translationum is still far from complete
some fifty countries are outside its list of contributors.
But even with the information at present available certain
trends are apparent and it is possible to estimate to a
fair degree the amount of communication between East
and West and what the future is likely to produce In this
respect.
Figures given In the tables printed here are,
at first glance, a distinct improvement on those
given five years ago. One's immediate reaction Is to say
that progress, however slow, is being made and that
natural growth Is to be preferred to any artificial
stimulus. As Arthur Waley says: "What matters is that
a translator should have been excited by the work he
translates, should be haunted day and night by the
feeling that he must put it into his own language, and
should be in a state of restlessness and fret till he has
done so." Thus, perhaps, the present haphazard system,
given time, will produce a vast range of translations of
permanent value.
This, however, would be too facile an attitude and one
which a closer examination of the findings does not
6 support. A scrutiny of the figures In these tables in fact
suggests that the attitude In the field of translation, both
from East to West and from West to East, is mostly
lackadaisical, and that there is need for some positive
action to overcome this present state of lethargy, which
otherwise may continue for some time to come.
A look at the first table on page 8, showing the transla¬
tions from Western languages published in Asia, reveals
that the origin of most works translated lies In four
countries only. The translations from the rest are
negligible and often relate merely to "obvious" transla¬
tions of books written about the countries into whose
languages they have been translated. Thus the East
continues to know little or nothing of the classical and
modern writers of Scandinavia, Italy, and the Spanish-
speaking world, to name only three of the great language
groups.
What Is still more distressing is that no effort
has been made to translate the best of recent
scientific or technical works from these countries: in fact,
only Egypt, Japan and Korea have any large number of
translations of such works; the remaining countries have
mostly limited their translations to the humanities. Nor
does this mean that what was translated was necessarily
of solid worth: subtract the light fiction and the purely
sensational, and there is left a residue of some well-known
classics and a pitiful handful of modern works of merit.
CONT'D ON PAGE 8

Robert
Collison
Throughout the Far East
the wisdom of the classics
is preserved not only in
books but also as an element
of art, decoration and archi¬
tecture. When a famous
saying is written down by
an expert calligrapher, like
the Japanese one shown
here, It becomes a work
that can be appreciated
aesthetically in both the
Occident and the Orient.
But it is obvious that intel¬
lectual appreciation of the
great classics of the East
can only be brought to the
West through translations.

THE BARRIER (Cont'd)
A literary scandal translating from translations
The effort in translation is in fact less impressive than
would at first appear.
Another disturbing feature of these figures, as shown
In the second table on this page, Is the number of the
translations which have reached the East by way of a
second language usually English (1). Since most are
pure literature this feature is especially important, for
translation is not a very satisfactory re-export. As
Professor L.W. Tancock has said: "No literary work is
tasteless, like a glass of distilled water; it has its peculiar
aroma, or consistency or texture, which the translator
must try to transmit."
The translation of a translation Is thus- in danger of
being unpalatable If not positively misleading. Whether
one can safely draw the conclusion that the East is suffer¬
ing from a dearth of linguists, or whether as Is far more
likely one can assume that most available linguists are
more profitably employed (in a material sense) in other
pursuits, the fact is that the average reader in the East
has no access to the majority of French, German and
Russian works except through the intervention of English
translators, and practically none at all to works in other
Western languages (1).
T the risk of seeming to utter an endless
L-Jeremlad, I must also point out that even the
total figures are misleading, since India's bibliography
(the most substantial of all Asian bibliographies) is
Inflated by the need for providing translations of the same
book into three of four different languages in an effort
to overcome the formidable language-barriers of the sub¬
continent.
It is also interesting to see how closely the pattern of
translation follows the historical background of an Indivi¬
dual country, reflecting perhaps the continuance of an
educational policy which, originally introduced from the
West, has remained as part of the life of the people today.
(1) Editor's note. This situation is even more acute than the
author assumes, since it is not always possible for the editor of
Index Translationum to indicate with certainly in every case that
translations were made from the original text. It is further¬
more of interest to observe that in several countries, particularly
in those such as India, the UJSJ5.R. and others with more than
one widely spoken language, the use of a single language as a
pivot for further translations is, for practical reasons, a matter
of policy.
Thus, Indonesian translations are drawn mainly from
works in English or Dutch; Pakistan, Iran and Egypt show
particular preference for English books, and Viet-Nam for
both English and French.
How soon can one hope that each nation will venture
beyond its present cultural background in search of
horizons beyond? In this connexion, it is notable how
remarkably little each Asian country is translating of the
works of other Asian countries, in spite of the fact that
the language barriers in the East are quite as great as
those between East and West.
While the position in the East is alleviated to a
certain extent by the fact that English is
widely read and therefore access to much Western
literature Is greater than these figures would suggest, the
West Is not so fortunate. Few people in the
West know any Eastern language, and the majority of
those who do are language specialists.
Figures given in the table on page 9, showing the
Eastern literature translated Into Western languages, are
therefore the more Incomprehensible. The figures them¬
selves are disappointing: when the semi-religious classics,
the folklore, the political and philosophical works have
been subtracted, there is no reason for the West to be
proud of the residue. Moreover, very few scientific or
technical works have been translated, as though the West
were ignoring as It most certainly cannot afford to do
the developments In these fields in Asia.
The West is in fact in danger of being more ignorant
of Eastern literature than the East of Western literature,
and with far less excuse.
A further and most unexpected sidelight is that the
West seems to be almost universally ignorant of Chinese.
Of the 181 translations of Chinese works listed, no less
than 90 per cent were made through the medium of
another Western language usually English of Russian.
The situation is unfortunately only too clear: commercial
considerations are often paramount. If the publisher is
convinced that there is a ready market for any particular
item, the necessary funds are soon available; witness
Norway's translation of no less than fourteen of the
Nancy Drew series of detective stories in two years (entries
nos. 16379 to 16392), to select only one of the many such
examples.

It is always a temptation to draw too many conclusions
from statistics, and perhaps it would be wise to limit
oneself to the reflection that the Index Translationum
continues to confirm that contact in this field between
East and West Is haphazard, capricious and dependent
on highly irrelevant factors.
There is no villain in the piece: publishers must balance
their budgets, translators must find work that keeps them
alive, and a nation cannot demand what it does not even
know it is missing. But should such a situation be allow¬
ed to continue, and is there not a case for international
action?
At first sight the problem seems insoluble, but is it
really so? If a work Is made available in English, French,
Spanish, Russian, Arabic and Chinese, It becomes accessi¬
ble to most of the peoples of the world. That Is, six lan¬
guages will reach the great majority of the world's reading
population, and through them an individual work will
reach their fellow men by means of local translations
as happens now In India, the U.S.S.R., and Yugoslavia.
IIn spite of the world's vast output of books each
year how many of these are of outstanding
merit? Probably no single country could seriously name
more than a hundred in its own language, and in many
cases the number would be very much smaller. Would it
not be possible to make a world effort to ensure that, by
co-operative action between publishers and governments,
the best of each nation's current works are made
available in each of the six languages?
It Is true that Arthur Waley is doubtful of the wisdom
of sponsored translation programmes, but there is surely
a case for setting up an international translators' school,
on the lines of the Interpreters' School at Geneva, to
provide the necessary training for this work. In which
event the methods of the great Chinese translator Lin
Shu (1852-1924) might well be used by the students as a
means of combining oral and reading skills.
And, finally, would It not be a good Idea to give special
place to the translation of practical books, where niceties
of style and problems of politics and ideologies did not
arise, so that the whole world might share In the scientific
and technical advances now being made?
The enormous gaps In the translation of the literature
of the past would still remain to be filled as a retrospective
effort, but the modest step made In concentrating on
contemporary works might well stimulate some attempts
In this direction as well. The translations, when complet¬
ed, could be offered to publishers In the same way as
original works are submitted: only In cases of failure to
achieve publication by this means should it be necessary
to seek other ways of making the material available.
Perhaps there are other and better methods of overcom¬
ing the continuing barriers between East and West In the
world of literature, but one thing is certain: the present
position is unsatisfactory, and every means should be used
to examine the problem thoroughly and decide upon an
effective and speedy line of action before it is too late.
