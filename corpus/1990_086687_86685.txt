Rethinking scientific progress
By Marc Chapdelaine and Jacques Richardson

fAs our turbulent century draws to
its close, marking a thousand years
of spectacular growth in knowledge,
a new sensitivity about the state of
mankind can be discerned. This shift
in our cultural "temperature" results,
in part, from a realization that tech¬
nological changewhile greatly im¬
proving nutrition and health, for
instancecan harm the physical
nature of our world.
As part of its vocations in the
fields of information and culture,
Unesco organizes, every few years,
meetings of concentrated reflection
on societal issues affected by progress
in science and technology. In 1986,
some twenty-five specialists met in
Venice to contemplate "Science and
the Boundaries of Knowledge".1
Another two dozen experts from all
over the world met late last year in
Vancouver, Canada, to ponder the
theme "Science and Culture for the
21st Century: Agenda for Survival".
The choice of the word "survival"
may be intimidating, but an eminent
ecologist from Quebec present in
Vancouver, Pierre Dansereau, admit¬
ted that "it is scientists who are part
of the problem".
When our century began, scien¬
tific research was still a disparate
effort on the part of dedicated in¬
dividuals and practical inventorsnot
working in teams, yet motivated by
an intense desire to learn all about
nature and the universe beyond.
Today, stressed Moroccan edu¬
cator Mahdi Elmandjra at Vancouver,
our "learning processes and mental
structures" are relatively unchanged,
but there is a need for "greater fore¬
sight and much more balanced cul¬
tural communication".

Italian historian and philosopher
Nicola Dallaporta interpreted inequal¬
ities between North and South as
"breaks or violations of the sym¬
metries" that long existed among the
world's civilizations. These disrup¬
tions, she claimed, "create the prac¬
tically unlimited capacity of the world
to express in the most delicately
shaded ways" mankind's countless
thoughts and ideas.
Supporting this line of reasoning,
Yujiro Nakamura of Meiji University
in Tokyo noted what he called "cul¬
tural negativity". He explained: "Con¬
tact between different peoples and
nations has not brought mutual
respect, but often violent opposi¬
tion.... A culture should not impose
its rhythm on other cultures."
But asymmetry and negative
reactions can be corrected by what
we learn from nature, according to
Daniel A. Akyeampong, a mathemat¬
ical physicist from Ghana. "At each
stage in the development of science,
the new concepts arising have in¬
fluenced man in his understanding
and appreciation of his culture."
Recalling the rigour of investigation
in the natural sciences, he asked,
"Can nature's inherent symmetry find
pride of place in our social and cul¬
tural values?"
Such consciousness has pervad¬
ed the work undertaken by the
United Nations and its specialized
agencies.
Academician Josef Riman, a
geneticist from Czechoslovakia,
noted that non-governmental organi¬
zations also play a role in reconciling
scientific progress with human
needs, citing the example of the
newly developed Global Change

The Vancouver Declaration
sURVIVAL of the planet has be¬
come of centra! and immediate con¬
cern. The present situation requires
urgent measures in all sectors-
scientific, cultural, economic and po¬
litical, and a greater sensitization of
all mankind. We must make common
cause with all people on Earth against
a common enemy: any action that
threatens balance within our environ¬
ment or reduces our legacy to future
generations. Today, this becomes the
objective of the Vancouver Declara¬
tion on Survival.
Mankind confronting
survival
Our planet is unstablea constantly
changing heat engine. Life appeared
on its surface about four billion years
ago, and developed in balance with
an environment where sudden un¬
predictable change is the norm. The
discovery, over 200 years ago, of free
energy locked in fossil fuels has given
humankind the power to dominate
the whole planetary surface. In an un¬
believably short span of time, un¬
planned and almost mindlessly, our
species has become by far the largest
factor for change on the planet.
The consequences have been
drastic and unique in the history of
our species:
an accelerating increase in popu¬
lation growth over the past 1 50 years
from one billion to over five billion
with a current doubling time of 30
to 40 years;
a comparable increase in the use
of fossil fuels leading to global
pollution, climate and sea-level
change;
an accelerating destruction of the
habitat of life, initiating a massive and
irreversible episode of mass extinction
in the biospherethe basis of the
Earth's ecosystem;
an unimaginable expenditure of
resources and human ingenuity on
war and preparation for war.
This is all licensed by a belief in
the inexhaustible resources of the
planet encouraged by political and
economic systems that emphasize
short term profit and disregard the
real cost of production.
The situation facing mankind in¬
volves the collapse of any balance be¬
tween our species and the rest of life
on the planet. Paradoxically, at the
time when we stand at the threshold
of degeneration of the ecosystem
and degradation of the quality of life,
knowledge and science are now in a
position to provide both the human
creativity and the technology needed
to take remedial action and to redis¬
cover the harmony between nature
and mankind. Only the social and po¬
litical will is lacking.
The origins
of the problem
The origin of our present predica¬
ment lies fundamentally in certain de¬
velopments in science that were
essentially complete by the beginning
of the century. Those developments...
gave human beings a power over na¬
ture that has, until recently, produced
an ever-increasing, and seemingly
boundless, supply of material com¬
modities. Swept up in the exploita¬
tion of this power, humankind has
tended to shift its values to those
promoting the maximal realization of
the material possibilities that this new
power provides. The values associat¬
ed with dimensions of the human
potential that had been the founda¬
tions of earlier cultures were cor¬
respondingly suppressed. The
impoverishment of the conception of
man caused by this omission of other
human dimensions is precisely in line
with the "scientific" conception of
the universe as machine, and of man
as nothing but a cog within it....
However, scientific advances of
the present century have shown this
mechanical view of the universe to be
untenable on purely scientific
grounds. Thus the rational basis for
the mechanical conception of man
has been invalidated.
Alternative visions
In contemporary science, the older
rigid mechanical picture of the
universe is replaced by concepts that
permit a universe that is formed by
a continual creative input that is not
constrained by any mechanical law.
Man himself becomes an aspect of
this creative impulse.... The "self" be¬
comes thereby converted from a de-
terministically controlled cog in a
giant machine to an aspect of a free
creative impulse that is intrinsically
and immediately tied to the universe
as a whole....
The human species has reached
limits in its use of the external world
and also limits in its capacity to live
in a changing social and cultural en¬
vironment. Man's developing percep¬
tions in science suggest that he might
recapture lost beliefs and varieties of
spiritual experience. The present crit¬
ical situation in mankind's occupan¬
cy of the planet requires new visions,
rooted in a variety of cultures, in con¬
templating the future:
The perception of an organic mac¬
rocosm that recaptures the rhythms
of life would allow man to reintegrate
himself with nature and understand
his relationship in space and time to
all life and the physical world.
Recognition that a human being is
an aspect of the creative process that
gives form to the universe, enlarges
man's image of himself and allows
him to transcend the egoism that is
the principal cause of disharmony
among his fellows and between
mankind and nature.
The overcoming of fragmentation
of the body-mind-spirit unity, brought
about by unbalanced emphasis on
any one over the others, allows man
to discover within himself the reflec¬
tion of cosmos and its supreme unify¬
ing principle.
Such visions change the concep¬
tion of man in nature and call for a
radical transformation of models of
development; the elimination of
poverty, ignorance and misery; the
end of the arms race; introduction of
new learning processes, educational
systems and mental attitudes; im¬
plementation of better forms of redis¬
tribution to ensure social equity; a
new design for living based on a
reduction of waste; respect for bio¬
diversity, socio-economic diversi-
ty.and cultural diversity that tran¬
scends outmoded concepts of
sovereignty....
Time is shortevery delay in es¬
tablishing a world eco-cultural peace
will only increase the cost of survival.
We must recognize the reality of
a multi-religious world and the need
for the kind of tolerance that will
enable religions, whatever their
differences, to co-operate together.
This would contribute to meeting the
requirements for human survival and
for the nurturing of the shared core
values of human solidarity, human
rights and human dignity. This is the
common heritage of mankind that
derives from our perception of the
transcendental significance of human
existence, and from a new global
conscience.

programme of the International
Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).
ICSU, representing about a mil¬
lion scientists throughout the world,
is closely associated with Unesco. Its
Global Change scheme (known as
the International Geosphere-
Biosphere Programme) seeks to
achieve during the coming decade
better understanding of physical and
chemical relations in our planet's sub¬
systems. Riman added that a com¬
parable approach "would be
desirable in the complex study of man
for a better understanding of emo¬
tional and rational behaviour."
Sweden's Carl-Goran Heden, an
eminent microbiologist, strongly sup¬
ported initiatives by such non¬
governmental bodies and pointed to
the success of a group in his country
called IDEA (Innovations for Develop¬
ment Association), which periodically
awards prizes for achievements in the
management of farming, forestry,
fisheries, energy and water resources.
The former rector of the United
Nations University, Indonesia's Profes¬
sor Soedjatmoko, claimed that scien¬
tific progress in coming generations
requires that mankind "make adjust¬
ments in systems and processes of
governance". He foresaw philosophi¬
cal shifts amounting to "change that
may be a precondition for human sur¬
vival, posing challenges to societies
and individuals that are essentially
ethical".
Eleonora Barbieri Masini of Ita¬
ly, who is president of the World Fu¬
tures Studies Federation, cautioned
that we should think of the future in
terms of "alternative scenarios". She
believes that a "scenario of transi¬
tion" will be "sure in any case to take
place because of long-term trends in
population structures" in both de¬
veloping and industrialized countries.
Israeli linguist André Chouraqui
believes that shifts in population dis¬
tribution and a new vision of human¬
ity will evoke new approaches to
communication between peoples. He
recalled that it was once rare for peo¬
ple to speak two or more languages.
Only in the recent past has this lan¬
guage barrier become less common,
but Professor Chouraqui insisted that
at the basis of the cultural-religious
conflict between the Islamic and
Hebraic worlds, for example, "lies a
linguistic problem that should be con¬
fronted as we move tQwards the
twenty-first century".
In appraising the contributions of
science and culture to our well-being
(if not outright survival) in the next
century, perhaps the last word should
come from a professional communi¬
cator, Bernard Ostry, chairman and
chief executive officer of TV Ontario.
Unable to attend the symposium, he
presented a paper ¡n which he em¬
phasized that there is a link between
culture and communication just as
"there is between economy and com¬
munication". Proper use of television
must take account of the need for a
shared culture, rather than "impos¬
ing cultural uniformity. Without diver¬
sity of culture, there can be no true
intellectual and spiritual freedom",
now or in the future.
The Vancouver Declaration (see
page 47) was drafted at the end of
the symposium. Unesco plans to fol¬
low up the Venice and Vancouver
meetings at a session to be held in
Latin America in 1993.
