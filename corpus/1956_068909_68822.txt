Haunting museums
hidden in the jungle
by Franfz Laforest
SOUTH East Asia was the meeting
place of the civilizations of Outer
India and South China which,
superimposed on a vast pre-Aryan
and pre-Indonesian culture, produced
one great cultural entity embracing
all Asia of the monsoon area. The
coasts of India, Indo-China and
South China were the bases from
which these civilizations, taking on a
maritime character, extended their
cultural influence as far as Madagas¬
car and many of the islands in the
immense expanse of the Pacific Ocean.
One of the
most interesting
aspects of the
cultural unity
which was esta¬
blished between
several races,
from Eurasia to
the outer fringes
of Polynesia, is
the expansion
of Megalithic
culture whose
monuments are
associated with
a complicated
magico-religious
cultural pattern
about which we
still know very
little indeed.
The megaliths
appear to be
closely con¬
nected with the
various forms
of agrarian
"worship" : sun
worshipping,
phallic or erotic
worship (sym¬
bolizing the fer¬
tility of the
soil), and hu¬
man sacrifice, and the stones erected
had a definite funerary purpose.
Many of them are associated with the
souls of the dead, or were intended
as commemorative monuments.
Apart from various forms of archi¬
tecture such as terraces, truncated
pyramids, staircases and tiled walks,
several types of megalith are in
evidence, in an area stretching from
northern India, to Easter Island in
the Pacific. The best known are the
human or animal representations, of
which remarkable examples exist in
the islands of the Marquesas, in Su¬
matra and on Nia Island off the coast
of Sumatra.
In most of the countries, non-

presentational character. Several
morphological types of very curious
megaliths still puzzle archaelogists.
Vertical stones and horizontal ones

the Gilbert Islands, appear to sym¬

horizontally on smaller stones would
seem to be "seats for the souls of the
dead", or sacrificial altars.
On Nias Island, various megaliths
encircle regular seats and benches
bearing beautifully sculptured human
or animal heads. But the most
remarkable groups of megaliths are
those constituted by whole fields of
enormous jars carved in stone, found
in Laos and on Celebes Island; some
of these are as much as ten feet high
and five feet broad. Near the jars lie
a great many stone discs, weighing
several tons
and measuring
as much as four
feet in diameter.
Did these serve
as lids or
covers?. The
megaliths, i t
would seem,
were for fune¬
rary purposes.
Where social
conditions and
geographical
environ-
ment dictated,
wood was used
as raw material
by the "sculp¬
tors of gods",
before, along
with, or after
the use of stone
as, for instan¬
ce, in the "'tot¬
em", pillar or
tomb statues of
Outer India and
Oceania. These
different sculp¬
tures often stem
from the same
creative idea,
and from icono¬
graphy similar to that which is
widely found in Megalithic culture.
It is believed that at the end of the
Neolithic age in South East Asia the
great stone working techniques were
abandoned, the introduction of metal
implements encouraging the develop¬
ment of wood-working. The use of
wood contributed, in any event, to the
construction of a large ocean-going
fleet, which was a dynamic factor in
the development of many commu¬
nities and set on foot a great move¬
ment of trading and exchanges.
Continuity of tradition in wood
statuary occurs again with the Nagas
of Assam, the Proto-Indo-Chinese of
the mountains of Indo-China, the
Dayaks of Borneo, and in certain
islands of Micronesia, Indonesia,
Melanesia and Polynesia.
This statuary reflects the same
preoccupation with the supernatural.
It is, in particular, associated with the
worship of the dead. Even quite
recently the Jarai and Bahnar of the
Annamese mountains surrounded
their tombs with many sculptured
statues in human and animal forms.
This art of "detached" sculpture is
imbued both with a spirit of realism
which might have stemmed from
Hindu art, and with a "harmonious
archaism", a planned adherence to a
style which is very akin to the art
of Melanesia.
Certain Bahnar cemeteries which
have been abandoned to the whims of
nature offer a striking spectacle.
Hundreds of statues, covered with
moss, weathered by rain and shackled
, by tree roots, stand erect in the
depths of the luxuriant forest.
Tombs, now in ruin, are surrounded
by four small megaliths, and by
mysterious figures. The "thinkers",
at the corners, recall the korwars, of
Melanesia. Are these statues "com¬
panions" for the souls of the dead?
Some, highly erotic in character,
represent couples locked in an em¬
brace. Do they symbolize a rebirth,
or a survival?
These fascinating ana naunting
museums are filled with wooden
phantoms which, eaten up by weather
and decay, and imprisoned by the
forest growth, will eventually dis¬
appear, taking their secret with them.
The megaliths, however, will long
survive, as inscrutable relics of a
glorious past.
