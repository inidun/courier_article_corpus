aster," says Eduardo
Loayaza, fisheries advisor
with the World Bank's Agriculture
and Natural Resources Department.
"There are too many fishing boats
chasing too few fish. It's like defor¬
estation but it's invisible because it's
happening under water." Who is to
blame? The fishermen, who have
been described as "the last race of
hunter-gatherers, out to snatch what
they can, while they can"? Govern¬
ments? International organizations,
which seem unable to enforce regu¬
lations drawn up after tough negoti¬
ations? Or technological progress
that makes fishing boats and equip¬
ment increasingly efficient?
A UNITED RESOURCE
On one point everyone is agreed:
the seas are emptying. Once they
were very full. There are more than
20,000 species ofmarine mammals
grouped into 350 families. Some
fish, such as cod, mackerel, sardine
and tuna, are migrators. Others such
as salmon and eel divide their lives
between sea water and fresh water.
Others still, such as grey mullet, red
mullet, sole and skate, live near
coasts. Four-fifths of the earth's
animal life lives in the seas and
oceans, which provide the world's
population with an average of4% of
its food. In Asia alone more than a
billion people depend on fish and
seafood as their major source of
animal protein, while approxi¬
mately 60% of the people in devel¬
oping countries derive 40% or more
of their animal protein from fish.
How are fish stocks evaluated?
At the beginning of the 20th cen¬
tury the countries of northern
Europe created the International
Council for Exploration of the Sea
and launched the first programmes
to measure the impact of fishing on
fish resources. In the 1940s mathe¬
matical models were established
and were widely used by special¬
ists. For several decades, attention
focused on fish resources and their
management, and quotas were
fixed.
More recently the question of
resources management began to be
studied by fisheries biologists,
whose mission, as described by
Jacques Guegen of the French
Research Institute for Exploiting the
Sea (IFREMER), is "to quantify
marine animal (or plant) stocks in
order to define the catch that may
be taken without endangering a
species' continued existence." Fish¬
eries biologists have several
methods at their disposal. One is
experimentally fishing a given stock
(i.e. fish with similar biological char¬
acteristics living in the same region)
and then extrapolating the results to
the entire geographical area.
Another is to count the eggs mixed
in with the plankton in spawning

grounds. Alternatively, schools of
fish can be detected by means of
sonar, a technique used in subma¬
rine warfare. Mathematical models
are used to establish a link between
fishing methods and the amount of
fish caught. They enable experts
working in the laboratory to draw
practical conclusions, e.g. calling
for larger mesh in fishing nets,
increasing or reducing the amount
of fish caught or modifying the
fishing season.
According to statistics published
by the Food and Agriculture Orga¬
nization of the United Nations
(FAO), marine catches grew from
20 million tons in 1950 to reach 86
million tons in 1989. In a document
published in 1993 FAO stated that
"the world fish catch has increased
more than four times in the past 40
years, but the over- intensive use of
modern technology and search for
short-term benefits, coupled with
continuous government support
for otherwise uneconomic produc¬
tion, has had a devastating impact
on many important fish stocks.
Commercial fleets have driven
some species to commercial extinc¬
tion and sometimes close to bio¬
logical extinction, by destroying
ecosystems such as coral reefs and
algae fields." In 1989 there were over
one million large-scale and twice
as many smaller scale fishing
boats on the world's oceans and
seas. A factory ship can freeze and
store up to 20 tons offish fillets per
day taken from 40 to 50 tons of fresh
fish. But to operate economically

such vessels need to be supplied
with large catches. Boats are there¬
fore constantly being modified and
increased in size.
Modern fishing techniques
include the use of long-lines that
may be up to 100 km long; bottom
trawls that rake the sea bed; purse
seine nets (up to 1,000 metres long
and 100 metres high) that encircle
shoals offish; gill-nets (up to 60 km
long) that are made ofhard-to-detect
nylon filament and are maintained
vertical by a system of floats and
weights. The non-governmental
organization Greenpeace reports
that one of the world's biggest trawl
nets measures 110 metres by 170
metres at its mouth and has an
overall capacity of 30,000 m2, large
enough to encircle twelve Boeing
747's. An even bigger net, now under
construction in Iceland, will have a
30% larger opening. FAO has clas¬
sified almost every commercial fish
species in every ocean and sea as
"depleted", "fully-exploited" or
"over-exploited".
Fish are a limited resource. For¬
tunately they are highly fertile, but
they need time to reproduce. It takes
cod, for example, seven or eight
years to reach sexual maturity. As
Alain Maucorps, of the Department
of Fish Resources of IFREMER,
writes, "Extreme overexploitation
occurs when not enough young fish
reach reproductive age. There is a
fertile biomass (the cumulative
weight of the stock) threshold
beneath which the number of
exploitable fish and thus the very
survival of the stock can be seri¬
ously endangered. Simulation
models demonstrate that as soon
as this threshold is reached, the
stock can disappear very quickly."
WASTE
Catching fish when they are too
young is thus dangerous for the
species. And yet from 50% to 80% of
the hake caught in the Bay ofBiscay
(between France and Spain) are
smaller than the regulation min¬
imum because net mesh-size is too
small. Waste is another very serious
problem. In Guyana, for example,
for every 5,000 tons ofshrimp taken,
fishermen throw away 20,000 tons

of dead or dying fish they don't
want. The International Council for
Exploration of the Sea estimates
that 80 million cod were thrown
away off the north Norwegian coast
inl986andl987 because they were
too small to sell, a waste of nearly
100,000 tons. Other annual catches
of which Greenpeace is strongly
critical are the 100,000 blue sharks,
the 48,000 GulfofMexico sea turtles,
birds (an estimated 750,000,
including 44,000 albatross) and
marine mammals such as whales
and dolphins, especially in the trop¬
ical eastern Pacific where the purse
seine nets used by tuna fishers
imprison not only fish but also
cetaceans looking for the same
food.
SAVING FISH TO SAVE FISHING
In a document calling for the pro¬
hibition of driftnets, the French
environmental group Equipe
Cousteau considers that without a
total ban on this gear "fishing will
soon be nothing more than a
memory". The Cousteau team
recalls that "in 1991 the United
Nations General Assemblyvoted for
a ban on driftnets longer than 2.5
kms., to take effect in 1992. The
United States, then the European
Union, decided to adopt this rec¬
ommendation, but France, where
about forty vessels practise tuna
fishing with driftnets, was granted a
special exemption."
The United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea was adopted
in 1982, and although it has not yet
entered into force, its principles are
widely accepted as customary by
fishing and coastal countries. In the
Convention, the principle of free
access to fisheries resources is aban¬
doned and fish, previously consid¬
ered res nullius (belonging to no
one), have become res communes
(whose users can be defined at the
international level). Coastal states
have Exclusive Economic Zones
extending 200 miles from their
shores (except in the Mediter¬
ranean) in which they must monitor
fishing boats and the gear they use.
But no one really has the means to
do this.
Another problem lies with devel¬
oping countries which transfer their
fishing rights, then see their waters
plundered by industrial fishing
fleets which deprive them of an
indispensable source of protein.
This is particularly hard to accept
when the fish is converted into fer¬
tilizer and food for domestic ani¬
mals, chicken, cattle and even . . .
pen-reared fish!
The situation is critical. It remains
to be seen which will die out first,
the fish or the fishermen.
