The soul of S u z h o u ’s gardens
The Suzhou gardens in southern China recreate nature in miniature to celebrate the
harmony between heaven and Earth. An initiate guides us along their winding paths,
decoding a host of refined symbols

In the 13th century, the Ve n e t i a n
merchant and adventurer Marco
Polo was the first Westerner to
introduce Suzhou to Europe. Fo r
h i m , this paradise on Earth was
above all a flourishing silk-production
c e n t r e. L a t e r,other Europeans fascinated
by the city,which is criss-crossed by canals,
called it “the Venice of the Orient.” I n
the 1980s, I helped to spread Suzhou’s
fame by presenting it as a paradise for
gourmets in my novel,The Gourmet.A n d
w h e n , in 1997, UN E S C O inscribed Suzhou
on the World Heritage List because of
its classical gardens, the town’s reputation
acquired yet another dimension.
Cruel as they may be, human beings are children
of nature and cannot live without mountains,w a t e r,
g r a s s, t r e e s, sunshine and air. If we are far away
from those elements, we feel stifle d , ill at ease,
t r a p p e d .As soon as we can,we go on vacation. B u t
rather than travel,which can be a tiring, expensive
and even dangerous exercise, why not make a
replica of nature in miniature,“an artificial nature”
intended for daily use?
In Europe, for example,parks are huge.I m m e n s e
forests crossed by abundant rivers stretch as far as
the eye can see without any obstacles to mar nature’s
s p e c t a c l e.These parks are actually large stretches of
nature that have been “fenced off” and touched up
a bit by adding a building here and there on the
banks of a river or at the edge of the woods.
Chinese landscaped gardens,on the other hand,
put more emphasis on the idea of harmony between
heaven and Earth, a salient feature of Chinese
philosophy. The gardens of Suzhou are actually a
man-made landscape. Its designers have replicated
all of nature’s basic features in miniature on flat
ground.Since it is impossible to move mountains,
they built rock gardens. Since the courses of rivers
cannot be changed, they dug canals into the earth
and made water flow through them.And the ground
beneath Suzhou is so gorged with water that all it
takes is a hole three metres deep to create a pond.
The people who live there, without a false sense of
s h a m e, acknowledge that they have “ f a l s i f i e d ”
mountains and rivers. But that “falsification” is a
work of art in the fullest sense of the term and,
consequently, fundamentally truthful.

come from Lake Ta i , which is located near Suzhou.
Worn down by erosion, these delightful, steep rocks
were so famous that even the emperors of the distant
north sent their builders to bring them back to
decorate their gardens. The most famous and
precious among them are called “rock peaks.”Th e
assessment of their quality is based on three criteria.
They must be “ s l e n d e r ” rather than “ b u l k y,” t h e y
must contain horizontal as well as vertical “ t u n n e l s ” ;
and their surface must be wrinkled rather than
s m o o t h .
But there is more to creating a work of art than
piling up beautiful rocks. The first rock garden
m a s t e r s,highly skilled and very cultured craftsmen,
appeared at Suzhou under the Tang (618-907) and
Song (907-1271) dynasties, a period when gardens
were flourishing everywhere in China. Th e
successors of these first landscape designers were so
numerous and talented that under the Ming dynasty
( 1 3 6 8 - 1 6 4 4 ) , the town and its surrounding area was
dotted with between 200 and 300 gardens.To d a y, 7 7
are left,of which 27 have been designated national
l a n d m a r k s. But many of them are actually just large
courtyards containing small gardens decorated with
flo w e r s, p l a n t s, bamboo and rocks, like the ones
that were once found in most of Suzhou’s houses.
Changing the landscape with every
step: a rule of garden design
Qing Gu Yliang was an undisputed master under
the Qing dynasty (1644-1840). He created the
limestone “Mountain of the Villa of Embracing
B e a u t y ”1 (H u a n x i u) . Gu Yliang went blind towards
the end of his life, but his followers completed the
work under his supervision. And therein lies the
secret of the mountain’s beauty:it was built by the
master’s soul,rather than his hands. It is the exact
r e p l i c a , in miniature,of the real mountain that lived
in his heart. Its dimensions are modest—it covers
less than 500 square metres and its peaks are no
more than seven metres high. But the moment you
go inside,you feel as though you are walking into the
entrails of a huge, wild mountain located on the
edge of a winding gorge. And you think of these
words by Chen Congzhou,a current-day specialist
on Chinese gardens:“the mountain that looks like
a rock garden is strange; the rock garden that looks
like a mountain is a thing of wonder.”
H o w e v e r, it takes more than a mountain to
make a landscape.Water is another of the gardens’
crucial features. But to bring water to the gardens,
it is necessary to either make use of an already-
existing pond or stream,or dig into the ground.In
any case, the builders must know how to open
trenches and make water flow through them, t o
create and then re-unite the branches of a river. In
short,they must know how to imitate the bends of
a river in order to obtain what we call “ s i n u o u s
c u r r e n t s.” The masters of Suzhou excelled in this art.
Rivers mean bridges.The gardens of Suzhou are
dotted with all manner of miniature stone and wooden
s p a n s. For example, the “Garden of the Master of
N e t s ”1(Wa n g s h i y u a n) has a very pretty little bridge
that can be crossed in two or three strides.
Suzhou has mountains, r i v e r s,bridges—but what
about trees? A landscape with neither plants nor
flowers is a desert.Old trees are the most precious
feature of classical Chinese gardens because
anything is possible, including laying out a Suzhou
garden in the United States, except making an old
tree. In the  “Lingering Garden” 1(Liuyuan) there
is a thousand-year-old ginkgo tree.The shade of its
fan-shaped foliage is where the master decided to
build the rock garden.
Visitors to Suzhou must not be impatient.U n l i k e
Ve r s a i l l e s, where the splendid vista of palace and
park can be taken in with a single, sweeping glance,
the gardens of Suzhou are hidden behind narrow
streets like demoiselles in a boudoir.When you walk
into a garden, you might even feel a bit disappointed:
the first thing you see is a long, zig-zagging gallery.
This is the “winding path leading to serene beauty,”
a basic feature of the garden’s architecture.At fir s t
s i g h t , it may not look very interesting.But before you
know it, a patch of garden behind a wall will wink at
you through the latticework of a sculpted window.
Trees and pavilions can be made out in the distance.
After a few steps on a winding path, a magnific e n t
garden appears before your eyes.
“Changing the landscape with every step” i s
the second rule that must be observed in classical
Chinese garden design.The scene shifts as you walk
along. To avoid the impression of monotony and
r e p e t i t i o n , the designers erected walls pierced with
sculpted windows that divide the gardens into
The gardens are dotted with miniature stone and wooden spans.

several sections without obstructing a view of the
entire complex. Your eyes are never at rest in a
garden of Suzhou.At every turn, the sight of a rock,
a stand of bamboo or a banana tree takes the visitor
by surprise. Each plot of land has been designed to
resemble a splendid painting. A dead angle here
would be like a failed brushstroke.
This method of dividing up space with doors,
w i n d o w s, g a l l e r i e s, rock gardens and streams creates
the impression of contemplating a scale-model of
n a t u r e. It provides what we call “a glimpse of
grandeur through the miniature.”
Gardens inspired by poets,
painters and calligraphers
To d a y, landscape architects design projects
before building a park or playground.The masters
of the gardens of Suzhou had no plans. They took
their ideas from poetry. They also drew plenty of
inspiration from Chinese painters, who often
returned the compliment by exalting the beauty of
their works. Th u s, many painters, poets and
calligraphers helped to create the gardens of
Suzhou.
The gardens were never really fin i s h e d .As time
went by, they were enlarged, enhanced and
p e r f e c t e d .Once a rock garden,a stream or a pavilion
was completed, the masters had the custom of
inviting their lettered friends to savour famous
liqueurs and give free reign to their fertile
i m a g i n a t i o n s. The guests inscribed calligraphy on
the door lintels and parallel sentences on the
u p r i g h t s2.They also gave advice on where to build a
new bridge or pavilion. L a t e r, the masters
embellished the garden heeding the advice they had
received and invited their friends back to have a
drink and write poetry.
Had it been any other way, the gardens of
Suzhou probably would not have the refinement
that has made them so famous. ■
