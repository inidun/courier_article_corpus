E D I TO R I A L
September 1998 -The UNESCO Courier 9
It is too often forgotten that the Unive rsal Declaration of Human Rights is not only
c o n c e rned with civil and political rights but also with what are known as economic
and social ri g h t s. In the preamble to the Declarat i o n , it is stipulated that “ F r e e d o m
from fear and wa n t ” is “the highest aspiration of the common people.” It is no coin-
cidence that the Declaration dates from the period when the foundations of the Uni-
ted Nations system were laid and the Marshall Plan was launched. At that time it wa s
possible to dream; pain and precarity were conducive to utopia; it was a time when a
common horizon could be redraw n .
To d ay, the civilization and culture of which we are so proud will break dow n
unless we can stabilize and halt population gr ow t h , n a rr ow the gap between rich and
p o o r , and create decent living conditions–educat i o n , public health, wo r k , h o u s i n g – f o r
the billions of people who share this beautiful planet.
UNESCO believes that in order to successfully take up the challenge of pove rt y,
four basic principles must be taken into account.
- Development of endogenous capacities. This means giving each country, e a c h
people and each person the capacity to decide for themselve s , to make their ow n
c h o i c e s , to exploit on their own account the natural resources around them. T h i s
i m p e r at i ve has a name: c o - o p e r at i o n . It is something quite different from technical and
other forms of assistance, such as they have been implemented hithert o.
- Improvement of the quality of life in rural areas. I f, in peacetime, we manage to
mobilize all resources, including those of the armed forces, then this quality of life will
reach the point at which immigr at i o n , p ri m a rily to the pove rty belts around the big
cities and then towards foreign countri e s , will disap-
pear or at least diminish.
- Citizenship and part i c i p at i o n , especially at the
local leve l . This is where democracy is cemented and
where the guidelines traced by gove rnments should be
implemented by all citizens. It is here too that
UNESCO envisages an extraordinary development of
new jobs, new ways of taking part in working life, e s p e-
cially in environmental management.
- Continuing and out-of-school educat i o n . This is
i m p o rtant for its own sake, of cours e , but also for the
global nexus of inform ation and communication that is
indispensable in today ’s wo r l d . No one should be able
to say that the train has left without them. E ve ryone must have an opport u n i t y, in the
c o u rse of their live s , to climb back onto the train of educat i o n , d i g n i t y, training and
d e m o c r a cy. This possibility is one of the basic principles of the culture of peace.
But if the rich countries have been incapable of devoting 0.7 per cent of their
GNP to the development of the most disadvantaged countri e s , h ow can we hope to
b ring to fruition the common enterp rise known as sustainable development? How
can this be done when, until not so long ago, d e velopment was regarded as little more
than economic gr ow t h , when the idea prevailed that a country would become modern
and its people would have a better life if it increased its industrial output or its rate of
e l e c t ricity consumption? The inevitable corollary of that mistake is to impose models
of development from the outside on the peoples who must apply them, taking no
account of their specific histori c a l , cultural or psychological backgr o u n d . The most
i m m e d i ate consequence of this approach is the gigantic moral and mat e rial cost paid
by many countries subjected to measures of macro-economic adjustment. Pa r a d ox i-
c a l l y, this sometimes leads to the bolstering of military regi m e s , the weakening of
civil society and the retreat of democracy because the problems which it causes extend
the repressive apparatus of the stat e .
Of course the development process includes a quantitat i ve and economic compo-
n e n t . B u t , as the Spanish philosopher Julián Marías once said, “nothing that is human
is purely quantitat i ve ” . P r o gress does not consist of the accumulation of objects,
nuclear missiles, automobiles or computers. It is indissociable from morality, from a
t e l e o l o gical dimension of existence. When we ask questions about progr e s s , the firs t
question is not “ h ow much or how many ? ” but “for whom?” ■



Progress for whom?
Federico Mayor
If the rich countries have been incapable of
devoting 0.7 per cent of their GNP to the
development of the most disadvantaged
countries, how can we hope to bring to
fruition the common enterprise known as
sustainable development?
