Without by-passing their own depart m e n t s
of human resources, big companies are
increasingly recruiting employe e s
through intern ational head-hunting agencies.
Lafarge,a French multinational specializing in the
m a n u facture of construction mat e ri a l s , spent months
looking for an engineer to supervise quality control,
the organization and management of laborat o ry
staff and customer relations for its Cameroonian
s u b s i d i a ry. E ventually it contacted A f ri c S e a r c h ,
which specializes in spotting talented A f ricans trai-
ned in the West and putting them in touch with firm s
established in Africa.
One of their recent recruits is a young Came-
r o o n i a n , G a b riel Bekemen, was hired in Pa ri s
just after gr a d u at i n g . To d ay he is a quality-
control engineer in a laborat o ry in the tow n
where he was born . “I studied engi n e e ring in
Pa ris at the Ecole Po l y t e c h n i q u e ,” he say s. “ T h e n
I did a master’s degree in quality-control mana-
gement at the Centre for Higher Industrial Stu-
d i e s , and later obtained a diploma in finance at
the National A rts and Crafts Centre. I answe r e d
a press adve rtisement and shortly afterwards wa s
contacted by A f ri c S e a r c h , where I was selected
from among twenty other candidates after a
number of tests and interv i e w s. I think that what
most helped me to get the job was the fact that I
had worked to pay my way while I was a stu-
d e n t .”
“When multinational companies operating in
A f rica want someone with technical qualifica-



The talent spotters
In search of that precious raw material–intelligence–
multinationals are skimming the cream of the student
crop

tions that are unavailable locally, they look elsew-
h e r e ,” explains Je a n - P i e rre Kwe d i , a consultant
and partner at A f ri c S e a r c h . “They are looking
for sound training as provided by the unive rs i t i e s
and higher education institutes, but they also
want candidates to ori gi n ate from the country in
question or at least be A f ri c a n , since they will
adapt more easily to a social, economic and cul-
tural context which they know we l l .”
Diplomas aren’t everything
For other companies, n ationality or experi e n c e
make little difference. Guido Tommei is respon-
sible for staff recruitment for A f rica at Schlum-
b e r g e r , a multinational company which offers
s e rvices and know h ow to major oil companies.
“ We pri m a rily recruit recent young gr a d u at e s ,”
he say s , “regardless of nationality and or expe-
ri e n c e , who are prepared to work in tough condi-
tions and adapt to different situat i o n s.”
Pascal Devoulon of Alexandre T i c, a French
e m p l oyment agency which forms par t of an
i n t e rn ational netwo r k , sets a high pri o rity on per-
sonal initiat i ve . “Unsolicited job applicat i o n s
r e c e i ve more attention than many people think,”
he say s. “In our company we place such applica-
tions on file and summon candidates when we
r e c e i ve a request that matches their qualifica-
t i o n s.”
Besides the usual methods like press adve rt i-
s e m e n t s , unsolicited applications and contact
over the Intern e t , m a ny firms find that trainee-
ships for students or recent gr a d u ates are the
best way of getting to know an individual’s abili-
t i e s. If trainees’ p r o files match the firm ’s requi-
r e m e n t s , they are hired more or less on the spot.
This explains why big firms are tending to
make exchange agreements with unive rsities and
other higher education institutions. P h i l i p s , a
Dutch multinational with 250,000 staff spread
out over five continents, takes on 20,000 new
e m p l oyees eve ry ye a r. Of these, 20 per cent are
young gr a d u ates who will work mainly in
r e s e a r c h , technical deve l o p m e n t , i n f o rm at i o n
technology or electronics and product marketing
and sales. “ M a ny of our staff come from the trai-
ning forums and programmes we organize with
leading unive rsities in all world regions where we
do bu s i n e s s , for example IMD Unive rsity in
S w i t z e r l a n d , the London Business School in Bri-
t a i n , Supelec in France and the Rotterdam
School of A d vanced Studies in the Netherlands,”
explains Yan Lave n a n , P h i l i p s ’ General Manager
for Human Resources.
But diplomas aren’t eve ry t h i n g . C h a r l e s -
H e n ri Dumond, president of Michel Pa g e , a lea-
ding European employment agency, w h i c h
r e c ruits 2,000 employees eve ry ye a r , is conv i n c e d
t h at initial experience is extremely important in
r e c ruiting a young pers o n . “Academic know l e d g e
is ve ry import a n t ,” he say s , “ but so is general
b a c k gr o u n d . Technical skills or diplomas from
p r e s t i gious schools have their place but we also
take into account the candidat e ’s pers o n a l i t y,
a d a p t a b i l i t y, k n owledge of languages and wo r k
as a trainee.” ■
