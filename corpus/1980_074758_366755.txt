Education
for social change
I should like to pay tribute. Ladies and
Gentlemen, to your Organization's
outstanding work, and at the same time
to the work of the States and institu¬
tions you represent and their commit¬
ment to the task of promoting the
general provision of education for the
people at large, at all grades and levels,
and of eradicating illiteracy, which
reflects the non-existence of even the
rudiments of instruction, a grievous
deficiency not only from the point of
view of the basic culture of individuals
and their environment, but also in terms
of socio-economic progress. There are
alarming signs of disparities in this field,
linked with an often acutely unequal
and unjust distribution of wealth: we
need only think of situations where a
small plutocratic oligarchy coexists with
starving multitudes living in extreme
poverty. The disparity can be remedied,
not through bloody struggles for
power, but, above all, by systematically
promoting literacy through the
widespread provision of education for
the masses. This is the direction in
which we must work if we wish after¬
wards to bring about the changes need¬
ed in the socio-economic domain. Man,
who "is more" because, also, of what
he "has", and what he "possesses",
must know how to possess, that is to
say, how to deal with and administer
the resources in his possession, for his
own good and for the common good.
For this, education is essential.
